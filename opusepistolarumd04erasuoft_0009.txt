PREFAOE

SINCE the third volume of this edition appeared, the republic
of learning, worldwide and international, has been shattered into
fragments by a war more devastating than any of those which
disturbed the sixteenth century. Seeking, not for itself, that
knowledge which leadeth unto wisdom—wisdom ‘the worker of
all things ', ‘which in all ages maketh men friends of God ’—-the
republic seemed to exhibit a pattern for a larger commonwealth‚
in which the nations of the world might willingly recognize the
rights of others and the duties of each one to all the rest. That
was the dream of Erasmus; and he looked for its fulfilment to
a union of kings, leading after them the peoples they protected.
Now in the twentieth century a war is over3 once more the work
of reconstruction must be attempted, and the world ‘is hoping for
a league of free nations, relieved, as are private men, from the
anxieties and suspicions which accompany the necessity of self-
defense. Nowhere is it more possible to begin welding up the
fragments than in the sphere of learning3 which cannot abate its
international character without losing its inspiration. The task
is not easy, especially for those who have suffered grievously3
but it will be undertaken, and with hope it will be carried
through.

In most countries the material difficulties are great. The War
caused of necessity a great diminution of printing3 and even
now the costs of production—papermaking and printing and
publishing—remam much higher than they were. This is a
serious hindrance to all learned work3 for it profits little to
make researches‚ if the fruits cannot be multiplied and diffused
to long life and usefulness through the medium of print. On all
sides may be heard lamentations over work delayed or even
abandoned. There is therefore every reason for me to express
my gratitude to the Delegates of the Clarendon Press for con-
tinuing this edition and allowing me to bring it further on its
way to completion.

These nine years which have elapsed‚ have cut off from me
