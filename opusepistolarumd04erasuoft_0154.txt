110 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1519

(Epp. 1074. 80-82, 1097. 6, 1098. 18 z cf. BRE. 170) even after his reconciliation
with them in Oct. 1519 (cf. Ep. 1016. 15n); having come to suspect (Ep. 1097.
26-7) that there was a wide difference between Lee’s original ms, notes and the
book actually published. Indead, in 1525 110 confidently declared (Ep. 1581)
that very little of this was Lee’s own handiwork.

Lee next proposed, in March 1519 (Ep. 1061. 692-4)‚ that Fisher should be asked
to judge between them, and for this purpose he sent his book to England. So
he wrote to More on 10 April (ΕΑΒ. f0. B⁴; EEv. p. 563 Jortin ii. 646); but
immediately afterwards appeared Erasmus’ ⁴ Apology against Latomus', dated
from Louvain, 28 March 1519, and printed by Thibault at Antwerp, s. a., with
a passage in which Lee, with good reason, considered himself lampooned (cf.
Ep. 1061. 21111). On 20 April he wrote again to More stating that he was com—
pelled by Erasinus' violence to print his book and appeal to the public verdict.
Erasmus' friends in England did their utmost to consti-ain their countryman to
silence. In March Fisher (of. Ep. 936. 90), More on 1 May (Ep. 1061. 6o3n)‚
Celet (cf. Apol. qua respondet, f0. G² v⁰., Jortin ii. 525), und Pace (Ep. 1074), pro-
bably about the same time, all wrote to protest against his conduct, no doubt
in response to appeals from Erasmus (cf. Esv. p. 80). Before these letters
arrived (Lee's Annot. 1⁴⁰. cc r0. and v0.) Lee attempted to carry out his intention
of publishing. Betaking himself to Antwerp in April or May, he tried first ,
Thibault (‘?) and then Hillen, but neither would undertake the book. This ξ
failure he ascribed without hesitation to Erasmus' intervention, a suspicion l
which may have had no ground but this, that they were in Antwerp together,
and indeed travelled back to Louvain on the same day, perhaps 6June 1519

E . 1061. 59311 .

< 'i'he letters 130111 England mentioned above, which reached Lee about this
time, mitigated his vexation 3 possibly, too, his patron Foxe may have responded
to Erasmus’ urgent entreaty (Ep. 973), and so in July (Ep. 1061. 690—6) he was
inclined to say he would not publish (cf. EEv.'p. 80). He communicated this
resolve to Pace at Antwerp (cf. Ep. 1001. 53n), and even entered into a definite
agreement on the subject (Ep. 1074. 71—33 cf. Epp. 1090, 1097). Buten returning
to Louvain from Antwerp at the end of July 1519 he was irritated by finding
the Dialoyus Trizinyuc’um (Ep. 1061. 50511) in circulationj. and a further attack
was made upon him by public placards (Ep. 1061. 50511). His good resolution
quickly disappeared, and he proceeded ‘to Antwerp again in October or November
(Ep. 1061. 60811) to find a printer, this preface being perhaps already written.
A second negotiation with Hillen was unsuccessful, again, as he alleges, by the
action of Erasmus : though it may be noticed that in October Erasmus was still
eager to obtain a sight of Lee’s notes, whether in print or otherwise (Epp. 1019,
1026, 1029, 1030). Later on, the appearance of Ep. 998 in the Farrago (cf. Ep.
1061. 23 and Ep. 1040 inti-od.) incensed Lee still more, and in turning over
that volume he may have lighted upon other unwelcome references to himself
(cf. Ep. 1061. 586n). So towards the end of 1519 he sent his book to Paris, -
where it was published (c. 15 Feb. 1520>—243 notes on the first edition of
Erasmus’ New Testament and twenty-five on the second. Within three days of
seeing it Erasmus replied in detail to Lee’s letter to Louvain aud Ep. 1061, with
his Apoloyz'a qua respondet, written before the end of February (Ep. 1072. 4-5) and
printed, no doubt, in March 1520 (cf. Epp. 1077, 1086) 3 and then with two Respon-
scones he combated Lee's Amzotationes in April and May (cf. Ep. 1092), all three 1
volumes being published by Hillen, though Mai-tens would gladly have had ᾗ
them E . 10 .

The( qipiarre7l7)cost Erasmus forty (Ep. 1098. 27-8) 01· fifty days (1, p. 22. 21,2; [¹
cf. Epp. 1117. 27, 1134. 25-6, 1139. 41), but suddenly came to 311 end. Early in
May 1520 he was still apprehensive of a further attack, and wrote to even more
powcrful patrous to avert it (Epp. 1097—9). But before the end of the mouth ¹
Froben produced at Basle, upon Erasmus' instigation (cf. BRE. 166), 3 volume 1
(B) which was a visiblc sign of peace concluded between the two combatants. l
All the bitterest parts of the controversy had been omitted—Lee‘s letter to ¹
Louvain and Ep. 1061, and Erasmus' rejoinder, the Apoloyia qua respondet (cf. 1,
p. 22. 18-21). There remained the merely critical portions, Lee’s Annotationes '
with this preface (Ep. 1037), and Erasmus’ two Responstones with a preface (Ep.
1100) written ostensibly in a better state of feeling. It seems probaffle, how-
ever, that Erasmus only consented to this new edition in deference to sug—
gestions from his English friends (cf. Epp. 1090, 1097) 3 for the series of letters 'P
