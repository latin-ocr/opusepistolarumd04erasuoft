1092. To NICHOLAS EVERARD.

LB. App. 315 (a). Antwerp.
Gudii Epistolae p. 380 (β). 17 April (1520).

[This letter and Ep. 1 188 were first printed by P. Burmann in 1697 in the same
volume as Ep. 949; from the collection of autograph letters belonging to Ant.
Vivien (1661-1707N‚ a member of a Dordrecht family, who had settled as a lawyer
at the Hague (see NNBW. ii. 1503 ; and Burmann’s preface‚ fo· **³ νο). The correc-
tions made by Leclerc show that he too had the original manuscript before him ε
though he does not mention Vivien in his preface. His text both here and in
Ep. 1188 is so much better than Burmann's that it must be placed first 3 but in
spelling and form of date Leclerc allowed himself such freedom that I have
preferred to follow Burmann,

The year-date can be assigned without hesitation from the mention of Erasmus’
replies to Lee (11. 4, 11), the second and third of which were printed by
Hillen at Antwerp in April and May 1520. In consequence the year-date, Anno
1521, which appears in α, may be attributed to the editors,

Nicholas Everardi or Everardus (c. 1462—9 Aug. 1532) of Middelburg was
a native of Walcheren. After studying at Louvain under Arnold de Beka and
Peter of Tirlemont he was LL.D. 11 June 14933 and, continuing there to teach
law, was Rector 1504. He also became Chaneellor to Erasmus’ patron, Henry of
Bergen, bishop of Cambray (cf. his consilium 110. 24). For a time he took
orders, and was appointed Dean of St. Guidon's at Anderlecht in 1498, and
Dean of St. Gudule's at Brussels in 1506. But shortly afterwards he returned
to civil life, married, and servecl as a member of the Grand Council of
Malines. In 1509 he was made President of the Council of Holland, Zeeland,
and Friesland3 and in 1528 President of the Grand Council in succession to
Josse Laurens.

He wrote Topicorum seu de locis legalibus liber, Louvain, Th. Martens, Feb. 1516,
addressed to John le Sauvage (Ep. 410), and with a preface by Remaclus Arduenna
(Ep. 411), who had been his pupil. This was reprinted at Bologna‚ J0.Bapt.
Hectoris, 27 Jan. 15283 and a new edition with his final corrections appeared
after his death, Louvain, S. Sassenus, 1552. His sonS, Everard, Nicholas, and
Adrian, also printed a volume of his Consilia, Louvain, 15543 which, as giving
details of the cases submitted to him for opinion, serve, like those of Zasius, to
illustrate the life of the times. In the seventeenth century his works were con-
sulted and several times reprinted. A translation of Lucian's De non credendo
calumniae by Rumoldus Stenemola, (Antwerp, M. Keyser, 1530), is dedicated to
him. One of his younger sons was Janus or Joannes Secundus (1511-36), author
of the Basia, who made some reputation as a poet.
