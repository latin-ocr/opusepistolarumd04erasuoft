ΤΟ CONRAD GOCLENIUS 505

1209]

On 1 Dec. 1519 Goclenius was appointed to supersede Barland as Professor of
Latin in Busleiden's College (Epp. 1050, 1051) ; a post which he held until his
death, only rarely leaving Louvain. His life was spent in teaching, for different
estimates of which see VZE. 90 3 and he received private pupils into his house.
In consequence his literary output was small: a poem on Erasmus' works,
c. May 1519 (see Ep. 870 introd.); some verses upon Martens’ second edition of
the Colloq. For-muzae (Ep. 1041) ; a translation of Lucian's Hermotimus, Louvain,
Th. Martens, 1522, dedicated to More3 and some notes on Cic. Off„ added to
Erasmus’ (cf. Ep. 1013) 111 1112 Froben edition of 1528. Val. Andreas mentions
also some 1115. 110125 011 cicero, and an edition of Lucan ; but the latter seems to
be apocryphal. About 1533 112 received a canonry at Antwerp (OE. p. 330).

With Erasmus he soon became an intimate friend: who could be recom-
mended to others (cf. Ep. 1018), and who was deserving of every praise (cf.
Epp. 1215, 1220, 1223, 1237, and a passage added 10 Aelay. 1659 111 Oct. 1520).
011 three occasions, beginning in 1521, Erasmus deposited money with him. and to
his hands was committed the Compendium Vitae (11 : see Ep. 1437] in 1524. He
was named for legacies in Erasmus' wills of 1527 and 1536 3 and in the former it
was proposed that he should come to Basle and supervise the projected edition
of Erasmus' collected works Erasmus' latest surviving letter, 28 June 1536, is
addressed to him; and for devotion to ‘the master’ he might almost be
ranked with Beatus Rhenanus and Boniface Amerbach. In the Ciceronianus
(LB. i. 1014 c) he is described as stout, with a very short neck, and inclined to
indolence.

Besides a collection of his letters to Erasmus in ms. at Basle. see ΟΕ, DGE,
and ΕΕ; val. Andreas, Colleyi trilinyuis exordia, 1614, pp. 47-50; and Neve pp.
143-9. Andr. Resendius dedicated to him 2 Carmen . . . aduersus stolidos politioris
literaturae oblatratores, Basle, Froben, Sept. 1531, of which there is a copy at
Schlettstadt (Cat. Rhen. 176); Alard of Amsterdam, who had been his friend
since 1519, composed verses for his tomb, speaking of him as ‘alter Erasmus ’;

gn} Peter Nanniusj his successor, pronounced a Funebris Oratio upon him, Louvain,
. assenus, 1542.

3. petam Germaniam] About this
time Erasmus wrote to Froben that he
should come to Basle as soon as he
knew for certain about the Emperor’s
movements: cf. VE. 264, dated 21
July 1521. Η15 letter is not extant.

4. nidum paratum] For Erasmus'
intention of returning to Louvain in the
spring cf. Ep. 1257. 10 : also Epp. 1233.
18811, 1239. 19. It appears from Ep. 1351
that he had left his books behind. Ep.
1322 shows that a room was· reserved
for him in the Collegium trilingue.
For the word cf. Epp. 314. 10, 1012. 4,
1342. 450.

A tradition of Erasmus' residence
in the College du Lis—that for about
two years 112 occupied the upper rooni
on a staircase (cf. Ep. 1347. 8-9), and
Rescius (l. 5) the lower—is to be
found in G. J. Vossius' De arte qram-
manca, 1635, p. 101, with the detail of
time added in the edition of 1662,

p. 107 (LB. i. 911). Τ112 story, which
comes from Rescius' pupil, Henry
Ravestein, at one time the possessor of
the original document of the Compen-
<lium Vitae (see vol. i, p. 575, has many
absurd inaccuracies (see Ι. Bywatw.
The Erasmc'an Pronwzcz'atc‘on ’μ’ Greek,
1908, pp. 8-10) ; but theti-adition given
above may well be true. It was written
down by Ravestein at Nijmegen on
27 Oct. 1569.

There is another detail, in the evi-
dence given, 13 July 1525, by Jan
Dierixsoen de Backer. an old school-
friend of Erasmus [see vol. i, p. 579)
before the Inquisitors Nic. Coppin
(Ep. 1162. 10811), Godesc. Rosemondt
(Ep. 1 153), Ruard Tappcr (Ep. 946. 311),
and Bern. Bucho (Ep. 1237), when
they were ‘trying his son, John Pis-
torius. He rec-alls to them that he
