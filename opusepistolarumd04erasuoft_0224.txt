180 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [¹5{{⁹5
1062. To LORENzo CAMPEGIO.
Paraphrasis ad Ephesios p. 3. Louvain.
Lond. xxix. 74: LB. vii. 967. 5 February Ῑ5ξςῧ.

[Τ110 preface to the Paraphrase on Ephesians (cf. Ep. 996. 6011); see also
1. 17511. As Erasmus was at Louvain, it is probable that, like the earlier Para-
phrases (Epp. 710, 916, 956: but cf. Ep. 1043), this too made its first appearance
from Martens’ press. No copy seems to be known z but Martens’ editions were
perhaps small—of Corinthians (Ep. 916) only three copies are known to me, of
Peter and Jude (Ep. 1112) two, of Hebrews (Ep. 1181) one, of James (Ep. 1171)
only a trace-—, and thus this may have disappeared. If there was a Louvain
edition, it cannot be dated later than Feb. 1520 3 for on 1 March 1520 Boniface
Amerbach writes to Zasius, ‘Scito omncs in totum Paulum Paraphrases ab
Erasmo absolutas: tibi communicaturus sum posteaquam excusae fuerint ‘
(Basle MS. G. VIa. 73. 286). Froben's first issue of this composition (a) is dated
in the samo month as Boniface’s letter ς but Erasmus seems to have been quickly
dissatisfied with his preface, for in Froben's next edition, March 1521 (β), he
materiallytransformed it, and made considerable additions, some of which closely
resemble passages in Ep. 1167-a letter which he wrote to Campegio just about
the time when he must have been revising this preface for β. Of the later
Froben editions enumerated on p. 123, the folio ot' 1532 (ε) shows some marks
of revision 3 and the octavo of 1523 (γ), the folio of 1523—4 (δ), the octavo of 1534
(ς), and the folios of 1540-1 (η) have a few, probably inadvertent, variants.

The texts osa and β for this preface are so diverse that it is not possible to
fuse them satisfactorily. 1 have therefore adopted the text of β 111 all points,
and have recorded the variants of 0. in the critical notes. A few lapses in Lond.‚
which LB. correctS, are disregarded here.

Erasmus used the opportunity offered, to address to Campegio an appeal on
behalf of good learning such as 110 had already sent to the Pope. and the Abp. of
Mainz (Epp. 1007, 1033) and quite recently to &Volsey (Ep. 1060> ε continuing to
connect the two Cardinals together in his mind, as he had done during

Ι Campegio's residence in England (cf. Epp. 968. 12y 969. 9, 970.15—18). Ep. 1183.

19 mentions a reply from Campegio, which is not, however, extant]
