[The following argument is given by Lypsius in the manuscript: ‘Ab Ant-
werpiensi oppido subiectum misit epistolium cuni omnibus chrysostomi operi-
bus, inscribens ea non, vti solebat, fratri M(artino)‚ sed toti collegio. Indicaram
enim illi quod affectu multo a nostro Suppriore desyderarentur. Author de

(Flluo rui-5181s a]git‚ nunquam deprehensus est.' The date is clearly not long after
PP- 104 79·

mine curabimus vt primum licebit. Quod Hagius non subscripsit
nomen, non est mirum ; nam si subscripsisset et esset laicus, ageretur
de capite illius. Est enim non solum libellus famosus verum et

seditiosus. Tu vide an sint argumenta quibus possit reuinci. Bene 5

1053lom To THOMAS LUPSET.

Epistolae eruditorum virorum p. 29 (a). Louvain.
F. p. 623: HN: Lond. xvii. 2: Lss. 481. 13 December 1519.

[It is clear from Ep. 1061. 637-40 and from two passages in the Apol. qua responcleff
(ff. O νο, D v⁰ 3 Jortin ii. 505, 510), that this letter was first printed by Martens

“ at Louvain. shortly after it was written. and when Lee had already sent his

book to Paris; and Ep. 1061. 626-7 shows that Martens’ issue was completed on
14 Dec. 1519, the day after this letter. A further indication of the date of this
separate publication is that to the points made here Lee replies in his letter of
1 Feb. (Ep. 1061) 3 having evidently seen thern in print, not 111 manuscript. In
reprinting ΕΑΒ. (p. 210) 111 ΕΕν., Aug. 1520, Froben prefixed this letter; taking
his text no doubt from Martens’ issue. Subsequently it was included in F
with very little change ; but in H Erasmus revised it somewhat, polishing away
the marks of rapid composition. No copy of the first issue is known to the
Ghent bibliographers ε 111 its absence Froben’s must serve* as the archetype.

In the Apoloyia qua respondet (f0. B* v⁰; Jortin ii. 5043 Erasmus rather loftily
declares that a letter like this could be written in half a day. It amounts
almost 1ο an Apologia, and as such is placed next to Epp. 1006, 998 in F (cf.
p. 9). The selection of Lupset lor recipient of it was perhaps suggested by
the fact that he was Lee’s countryman, and by the warinth with which, on a
visit from Paris to Louvain during 1519, he had espoused Erasmus’ cause
against Lee (Εεν. 76-8).]
