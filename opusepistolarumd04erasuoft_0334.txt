[Evidently written for Hutten to take to Brussels in June 1520: see Ep. 1113.
36n. Marlianus (Ep. 411. 8n) had just returned from Spain in Charles’ train.
About Aug. 1516 he had received the bishopric of Tuy in Galicia (Mart. E. 576) ;
and he had rapidly become an influential member of Charles' Council (cf. Ep.
1199. 4-5). Indeed Peter Martyr, who was his kinsman and fellow-countryman
(Mart. E. 696, 722), calls him ‘Caesaris semi-anima' (ibid. 655, 722); coupling
him with Gattinara (p. 359). For Erasmus' communicatione with him through
Barbirius during the Spanish period see Epp. 695. 50, 794. 85, 803. 3-5.]

MAIOREM in modum gaudeo, reuerende Pater, amplitudinem tuam
nobis esse redditam ; ne nullus mihi patronus sit in aula, posteaquam
obiit Syluagius nec rediit Barbirius. Neque enim dubito quin eum
animum sis praestaturus Erasmo quem hactenus semper praestitisti:

quoniam impense faueo, multos habeo qui mihi non fauent. Mitto

to Ferdinand’s court (LE.2 300. 226‚7
=HE. 160). In pursuance of this
scheme he set out from Mainz on 4
June (HE. 171, 171*: cf. ME. 78 and
Heumann p. 50=HE. 174) to lay his
plans before Ferdinand (cf. Ep. 1055.
2), who was now probably with Charles
at Brussels. On his way Hutten
hoped to see Erasmus at Louvain
(HE. 171*); and this intention he
carried out (cf. Spongia, LB. x. 1645A
=HE. 333,§ 128). Erasmus gave him
a letter of introduction to an influen-
tial member of Charles' Counoil (Ep.
1114); and after Hutten's departure to
Brussels wrote further in his praise to

But this he subsequently deplored3
see his letter of 8 May 15²4 to Luther
(LE.² 792. 63-6= HE. 364. 41-3). For
his friendly feeling towards Hutten at
this time see Ep. 1119. 33-4.
