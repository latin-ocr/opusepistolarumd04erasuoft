1120] FROM CONRAD FRIOK AND LAURENOE ESINGER 299

some distance up the valley of the Unditz, which debouches into the plain at
Ettenheim‚ s, of Lahr. Among the hills to the E. of Lahr lay the strong castle
of Geroldseck on the Schonbe1g, dominating the upper waters of the Schutter
to its w. and the Kinzig on its E. The situation of all three is carefully
described in a letter from Ottelinus of Lahr to Beatus Rhenanus, 27 Feb. 1531
(BRE. 272 ; but on p. 383. 31 for occidentem read orientem).

Conrad Frick († 3 April 1535) was elected Abbot of Schuttern on 12 J uly 1518:
but not much is known of him. In Feb. 1522 he was visiting Nuremberg (ZE.
266). In 1523 he was present at the election of an abbot for the Benedictine
house of Alpirsbach‚ high up in the valley of the Kinzig (GC. v. 1065). Luscinius
(Ep. 302. 1611) speaks of him as an old friend and tells a story of his humour in
letting a house in Strasburg (Ioci αο sales. Augsburg, S. Ruff, 13 Feb. 1524, 110. 82).
In May 1525 he took up arms with the nobles for the suppression of the
Peasants (ZE. 243), and in April 1526 was negotiating with the Austrian autho-
rities at Ensisheim for the restoration of the monks of Hiigshofen (BRE. 255).
Ηο had sufficient interest in history to promote the continuance of the Chronicle
of Schuttern begun by Ρ. Volz (Ep. 368): see F. J. Mone, Quellensammlzmy der
badischen Lcmdesqesch. iii, 1863, pp. 42, 56. The abbey of Schuttern owned a house
in Freiburg, at which Botzheim was staying in 1519 (ZE. pp. 492, 494). For
iuss. formerly belonging to Schutt-ern see L. Dorez in Melaozyes Emile Chatelain,
1910, PP· 293-9·

Laurence Esinger († 1544) of villingen. near Donaueschingen⁷ was elected
Abbot of Ettenheimmiinster 4 July 1500, and ruled there for more than 43
years (GC. v. 866). He was present with Abbot Conrad at Alpirsbach in 1523 ;
but beyond this Ι have found nothing about him.

In the manuscript volume this letter is bound up so tight that the last figure
of the year-date cannot be read: but it can be supplied without hesitation
from Zasius' other two letters mentioned above as written on the same day.

ἕο 13 ηο11]00111110 that there is 110 allusion to this affair of the two Abbots in
p. 1121.

S. P. D. Animauit nos, magne Erasme, doctissime heros, prae-
sentium exhibitor, vir ex solido laudatus et industrius, quatenus ad
vestram praestanciam vel modicis scriberemus. Subiecit calcar Zasius
ille, vestri nominis preco indefectus. qui ignem vos esse de celo
sumptum et non minore quam quemcunque ex vetustis Ecclesiae 5
cardinibus honore venerandum praedicat. Inuitabat porro singu—
laris necnon admirabilis vestra tum comitas tum benignitas; quae
duo prae innumeris aliis diuinis vestris dotibus praecipua in vobis
praedicantur. Ausi igitur vel inciuilius vos appellare, nostrarum
vobis necessitatum condicionem, quam ex domini Iohannis Salii 10
declaratione facile intelligetis, synceriter commendamus.

 

10. Salii] John Saltzman (Salius or

Nagy-Szebvn in Transylvania. A
Salianus) of Steyer in Upper Austria.

German version of this, Vienna, Jo.

His first known work is a poem on the
Annaberg (Ep. 1122. 1211 ,1, addressed
to the town-council of that young
seulement, 19 June 1507; and first
printed, apparently from the original
ms, by Michael Barth in his Amzaeberya,
Basle, Jo. Oporinus, March 1557. In
his preface Salius speaks of receiving
the poet's laurel from Maximilian, in
1506, in reward for a poem on Carin-
thia: and describes himself as M.D.
Next he wrote De praesentatione a pesti-
lentia, Vienna, H. Victor, 16 Nov. 15103
with a preface dated 12 Aug. from

Singren, 1521, styles him physician to
Ferdinand, and his preface is dated
from Gratz, 15 Sept. Ι have not seen
the book in either Latin or German:
but M.Denis‚ IVz'ens Buchclruckerqeschicht,
1782, p. 339, states that he had experi-
ence of the plague in Bohemia and
Moravia 1506—7‚ in Transylvania 1510.

He was a friend of Reuchhn, and
brought news of him to Erasmus just
about this time : see Ep. 1129. 111.
Aschbach (Gesch. d. Wiener Univ. ii. 98)
states that he was at one time Professor
of Medicine at Vienna.
