504 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 52 1

to Charles (Gachard ii. 57, iii. 25). In 1519 he was ambassador to the Duke of

Gueldres.

He had three sons: Henry († 154o); Martin, born e. 1509, father of the
Wm. of Hornes, leader of the ‘ malcontents ', who was executed by Alex. Far-
nese, 8 Nov. 15803 and Philip, who became Provost of St. John’s at Utrecht.
The boy mentioned here may have been any one of these.

CLARISS. D. MAXIMILIANO, DOMINO DE HORNES ET DE
GASBEEK‚ ERASMVS ROT. S. P.

VIR clarissime, huius loci amoenitas et hospitis inaudita humanitas
me sic reficit recreatque, vt prorsus mihi videar reuixisse. Accedit
Leonardi iucundissima consuetudo, qui paterno quodam animo filii
tui pueritiam format et instituit. Ex oratione vero Scholastici saepe

5 cogito celsitudinem tuam esse animo in me propenso: quo enim hoc

magis tibi debeo, hoc minus promereor. Vtinam esset in quo vicis-

sim animum in te gratum declarare possim! Agam hic fortassis

menses tres: totam enim bibliothecam huc transtuli. Interim si
vel consilio vel industria mea iuuare potero studia filii tui, nullus
10 deero officio grati hominis. Indoles pueri perplacet ; sed magni refert
apud quos et a quibus instituatur. Precor tibi fortunam isto animo
digniorem. Bene valeat tua celsitudo cum illustrissima domina
coniuge tua.

[The year-date may be accepted from the mention of Erasmus· impending visit ,Ι
to Basle; cf. Ep. 1216. 72. It is evident that he was away from Louvain. ·

Of conrad Goelenius (c. Dec. 1489—25 Jan. 1539)y from the village of Men- 1
geringhausen, near Arolsen in Waldeck, little is known before his appearance
at Louvain in 1519. Hamelmann (1580) styles him Pnderbornenffls, and adds
that he was educated at Deventer (Schriften, ed. K. Loffier, 1908, i. 4, pp. 18,
32, 55); mentioning also (ibid. i. 3, p. 274) a nephew John, son of a brother.
Reichling conjectures (J. Mizrmellivs, p. 5311) that he may be the ‘ Coenradus
Paterbornis ' who was M.A. at Cologne, 26 Max-eh 1504 ; but in view of his age,
given by Nannius (f0. 13²: see below) as just over 49 at his death, and of
Erasmus’ repeated description of him at this time as iuuenis, the identification
seems doubtful. Reichling also mentions (ibid. pp. 63, 141) a Hermann Goc-
kelen, parish-priest of Hamm, between Soest and Minister, who was perhaps ,“
a relation.
