LETTERS OF ERASMUS

templorum Louanii affixe, ac demum Epistolae ex officina Frobeniana
nuper emissae, et epistola ad Lupsetum. Ego non tam stupidus sum
vt hos tuos fucos non persentiam. Omnia agis, et nihil vis videri

agere. Hostis es, et tamen amici personam induis.

Sic fabulam agis

quasi spectatores haberes lapides, et te solum putas posse praestigiis

thing to show whether it was in print
as yet or in ms. z certainly it is short
enough to invite copying by hand.
Indication of date is given, however,
with some probability, by a ms. in-
scription, ‘Oct. 1519', on the title-page
of the copy from which Haupt re-
printed the dialogue in his Wilhelm u.

’ Conrad Nesea, 1843, pp. 77 seq.; and

the copy sent by Com-ad Grebel to
Vadianus, 6 Oct. 1519, from Melun,s.
of 'Paris (VE. 170) was very likely in
Resch's edition. Besides the first
edition (12330 aa. 55), the British Mu-
seum has alater 0110 (12314 aa. 57) with
the year-date 1520, and on the title—
page, ‘exactissime ad autoris arche·
typum recognitus': which Proctor
(11980) ascribes to Laz. Schiirer at
Schlettstadt. Van Iseghem mentions
a copy of another edition (no. 128),
which he believed to be by Martens,
at Louvain. Copies of the Dialogus
were sold by Jo. Dorne in Oxford,
25 Aug. and 13 Sept. 1520: see nos.
1134 and 1274 in his Day-book, ed. F.
Madan, OHS. v, 1885, pp. 117, 121. In

the Eccius dedolatus attributed to Pirck-

heimer, 1520, the pseudonyms of the

characters in the dialogue are inter·

preted, Phthonides being identified
with Lee (cf. l. 21111) ; see Huttem· Op„
ed. BOcking, iv. 535.

Steitz, in Archiv s. Franksurts Gesch„
Ν. F. vi (1877), pp. 74-8, follows Simler’s
edition of Gesner, 1583, p. 170, in
ascribing the dialogue to Wm. Nesen
(Ep. 329 introd.) ; with the suggestion
that he used his brother's name be-
cause Conrad, being unknown in Lou-
vain, would be safe from any disagree-
able consequences. Having come re·
cently from Paris (Ep. 994. 9n) Wm.
Nesen would probably have con-
nexions with Resch. But though Pace
(Env. p. 88) judged the work too
puerile to be by Erasmus, and though
in style and construction it is not
really like the Colloquies, there is
nevertheless some ground for the sus-
picions of Lee and Adelmann ; which
were shared by Zwingli also (Zw. Est
113). The dialoguc represents Eras-
mus’ point of view (ef. Epp. 761. 63,
794. 75) and makes fun 01‘ his oppo-

nents'. In the Apol. qua respondet (f0. 1)
v⁰; Jortin ii. 510) Erasmus uses much
equivocation, but makes no definite
denial of authorship; so, too, in
defending himself to Bucer in 1532
(cf. Ep. 495 introd.), ‘De dialogo
trilingui, vt largiamur quod tu su-
spicari videris, non illic ad Euan-
gelii persuasionem adhibetur fucus:
tametsi quid fuci est vbi nullum appo—
nitur nomen‘?' But a letter from
Boniface Amerbach to Zasius (Basle
Ms. C.VI². 73. 380 (c. Sept. 1519, just
when this dialogue was beginning to
be 011-0111οὺοᾰ» 5001115 almost con-

clusive: ‘Adiecimus hiis in Erasmo- ,

mastygas dialogum. Subodoraberis
auctorem. Non enim Lucianus festi-
<ui>us lusisset '. I cannot think of
any possible author, familiar also to
Zasius, for whom Boniface was likely
to be so discreetly reticent, other than
the master to whom he was 50 devoted
(cf. Ep. 1020), the translator of Lucian's
dialogueS. But the truth is perhaps
to 110 found, as with Lystrius' scholia
on the Μονία (500 Ep. 495 introd.) and
Faber's Consilium (Ep. 1149), in joint
authorship; that Nesen composed and
Erasmus polished, as Zwingli indeed
seems to suggest (Zw. ΕΡ 113). Cf.
also a note on Erasinus’ letter to Goele-
nius of 6 Feb. 1522.

L. Geiger, Viert. s. Kule. u. Lite. d.
Renaissance, 1(1886), pp. 247- 50, ascribes
the Dialoyus to Erasmus3 and men-
tions a copy in his own possession
which he believes to have been prs-
sented by Erasmus to Adehnann, with
an autograph inscription by Adelmann
declaring that Erasmus was the author.
O. Clemen in Arch. s. Refomnationsqesclc.
1, 1904, pp. 355-64, maintains the
authorship of Conr. Nesen.

505. infamatoriae] Cf. Env. p. 88. In
1115 Annotationes (1‘0. 002) Lee describes
these as printed. For other occasions
on which this method was used see
Epp. 1077. 3, 1168.

506. Epistolae] the Farraqo (E). Be-
sides Ep. 998, addresscd in no friendly
spirit to Lee, it contains damaging
references to him in Epp. 906. 448-66,
936· 31-5‚ 993- Ι7-43, 999· 315-21·

507. ad Lupsetum] Ep. 1053.
