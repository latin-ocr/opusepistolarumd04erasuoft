111 his si senseris tuo studio nostram industriam adiumento fuisse,
gratiam habeto 11011 1111111 sed Iesu Christo, cuius praesidio geritur
quicquid recte geritur a nobis. Quod si quid offenderis quod prima 15
statim specie displiceat, ne sis praeceps ad calumniandum. Suspende
sententiam donec consulueris nostras Annotationes. Absit autem
vt quorundam inauditam impudentiam velis imitari, qui priuatim ac
publice damnant quod profitentur se non legisse ; in hoc vel ipso
Zoilo iniquiores, quod is in Homeri carminibus diligenter excussis 20
quaedam carpserit, et haud scio an recte, atque interim ea certe
comprobauit quae non attigit. Isti clausis oculis andabatarum ritu
impugnant quod non vident, damnant quod quale sit nec intelligunt
nec curant intelligere. Atque, o mirum inscitiae supercilium, quod
summus Pontifex inspectum et examinatum dignum censuit quod 25
legatur a studiosis omnibus, id isti non inspectum odiosis clamoribus
insectantur, praesertim apud imperitos. Vnde haec iniquitas, ne
dicam peruersitas, inter Christianos, imo inter hos qui professione
religionis haberi volunt insignes? ⁷

Sed cum his litigare non est animus. Te, lector, appello, qui ad 30
Christi doctrinam adfers animum vere Christianum. Si quid satis-
facit palato tuo, fruere; tum aequior esto, sicubi prodesse studenti

parum successit pius conatus.

100410111066 FRoM WILL1AM BUDAEUS.

Epistolae Budaei, 1520, f. 121 v0 (a). Mai-ly.

F. p. 210: HN: Lond. iii. 68: Lss. 455. (September 1519.>
Budaei Epistolae‚ 1531, giu, f. 5 v0 (b).

Id. 1540, p. 30 (c): 1574, p. 40 (d).

[This letter was first printed by Budaeus with Epp. 1015, 1073 iu BER, Paris,
J. Badius, 20 Aug. 1520 (al : Bodl. B. 18. 16 Linc.), corrected in a later hnpressim
bearing the same date (a2 ε Bodl. Byw. K. 9. 9) ; and it was again included, with
Epp. 403, 435, 493, 522, 583, and others of later date to Erasmus, in BE³., Feb.
1531 (b). It might be conjectured that F would have been printed from the
actual letters received by Erasmus; but examination of its readings shows its
close dependenc(¹ upon a. Such differences as there are between them are
mainly rectifications of the iota subscript—a matter in which the early printers
of Greek were very uncertain, probably through the inadequacy of their supply
of type ; there are a few necessary corrections (11, 31, 62, 109), and some degenera-
tions (ll. 30, 43, 74, 101). As between a¹ and αἳ, the readings of 11. 4, 17, 28,
44, 73, 117, 124 show unquestionably that a2 was the archetype of F. This
inference is even more markedly evident in Ep. 1015, where some obvious mis-
prints which are special to 3², are faithfully reproduced in F.

It is clear therefore that Επεὶ-0111110-1-0111011111011113 perhaps Budaeus' notice
(Ep. 493. 45 seq.) of a misprint in Ep. 403. 149 as printed in B—instructed the
editors of F to follow Budaeus* published text with scrupulous care, leaving
them, however, free to correct undoubted errors in their original ; and further that
they used for the printing a copy of 11². This view of the facts supplies a further
:ind conclusive p1·0of(cf. vol. iii, pp. 627-8] that Ep. 1206 is to be placed 111 1521. It
may be noticed that in printing some of his own letters in ΒΕ3. rb) Budaeus
