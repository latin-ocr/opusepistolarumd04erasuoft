P. 185, Ep. 750 introd. 111 1915 Dr. J. A. Vor der Hake was good enough to
report to me the existence of the Codex Horawitzianus in the Public
Library at Rotterdam (Erasmus III. 102) ς 31111 shortly afterwards he lent
it to the Bodleian for my use, 1916-19. It is in Mai-tin Lypsius' auto-
graph throughout. Examination showed that Horawitz, though dis-
carding the original spelling, had on the whole done his work very well,
in printing the MS. in Horawitz v. Out of the 28 letters to or from
Erasmus, only six were printed by himself ς and of these. four appeared
in vol. iii of this edition. In Ep. 750 (p. 1) the text of the Rotterdain MS.
agrees on the whole with D ε a fact which suggests that Lypsius, having
copied the letter in an earlier letter-book from the document he actually
received, copied it a second time in a later book from the text as printed
in D. For Ep. 843 (p. 3), however, the ms. differs not a little from D2,
in a considerable number of quite unimportant variants. In Epp. 807
(pp. 27, 37), 897 (p. 2), which Erasmus printed first in F, the Rotterdam
MS. agrees more or less closely with the Brussels MS. ; in Ep. 897 having
a few variants of no real important-e. The text for the other two letters,
Epp. 1056, 1070, may be seen in this volume.

In the letters in vol. iii for which the Brussels and the Rotterdam MSS.
were the only authorities (Epp. 899. 901, 912, 921-2, 960) and the one
which is only found in the latter (Ep. 900), there are no variants of
importance to record between the Rotterdam MS. and Horawitz's text.

It remains to consider the relations between these two mss„ which are
both in Lypsius’ autograph throughout. The Brussels MS. is clearly the
earlier, since it contains nothing later than 1519 (Epp. 1048—9‚ 1052), or,
if Ep. 1130 is rightly dated, than 1520: whereas the Rotterdain MS. has
nothing of Erasmus earlier than 1518 (Ep. 750) and goes down to 1525.
Another point of difference is in the arguments prefixed to the letters
in the Brussels MS„ with the design of elucidating their contenis: in
the Rotterdam MS. there is nothing of the sort. To some extent the
