138 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1519

Goelenius for the Chair, led me to suggest that it was he who was the object
of Erasmus' indignation here. He certainly was a candidate against Goelenius.
But he cannot be intended here; for P. Nannius expressly states (Funebris
oratio pro Goelenio‚ Louvain, S. Zassenus, 1542, 1²⁰. 13³)‘t11at in the election Erasmus⁷
whole support was given to Ceratinus, and further dilates on Erasmus’ candour
in accepting Goclenius when duly appointed. Eppendorff‘s identification with
Barland (App. 14) may therefore be taken as correct; for though Eppendorff
was not in Louvain at this time, it can easily be imagined that while living
with Erasmus at Basle in the summer of 1522, he may have asked questions
about the enigmatic descriptions and allusions which he found in his newly
acquired copy of the Epistolae ad diuersos (F).

The identification seems to show that Barland’s appointment to the Latin
Chair in 1518 (cf. Ep. 492 introd.) was only provisional3 and that now, after
little more than a year, he had been obliged to give way to Goclenius. Under
these circumstances it may be conjectured that Ep. 1050 was written whilst
Erasmus was still at Louvain, when he had heard the first repert of Barland's
attacks on Goclenius; Ep. 1051 later, when full details of what had been said

had reac}1e{.liin1. Epp. 1163 and 1237 show that his indignation with Barland
was not as ing]

ERASMVS OVIDAM ΑΘΎῬΟΓΛΩΤΤΩΙ S. D.

NVNQVAM tam male de te sensurus eram, nisi teipsum adeo palam
declarasses; toties tibi dixi id quod res est, rem in mea manu non
fuisse, nec integra re te mihi locutum de professione. Sed finge
quod non est, executores totum negocium meae fidei concredidisse,
meque te praeterito Goclenium vt magis idoneum praetulisse; quid
erat cur sic in ine debacchareris, perinde quasi auum tuum ferro
necassem ⁴? Haec me quidem leuiter commouent, sed tui me miseret.
Si quid fuisset spei⁷ non defuissem officio.v Sciebam executores nullo
pacto propensos in te, etiam si de tuo addidisses duodecim libras.
Hoc tibi nolebam indicare; quid enim erat necesse? Crede mihi,
ista tua improbitate multorum animos abste alienas ; homines illici
volunt, non cogi. Nimirum isti sunt mores ob quos Abbas tam
parce tecum agit. Non, vt opinor, antehac sum male de te meritus,
si nihil bene meritus. Etiam nunc te admoneo vt in posterum
Nam minimum est in quo me possis
laedere. Bene vale.

Antuuerpiae. Pridie conceptae virginis matris. [Anno M.1›.XV111.]

17. H : Pridiae F. Anno M.D.xvrn add. H.

 

8. executores] To this charge Bus-
leiden had appointed Adrian Josel,
canon of Antwerp3 Nic. de Nispen,
secretary to Robert Croy, bp. of Cam—
bray3 and Barth. de VVessem, canon
of MalineS. Besides these, Stercke or
Robyns (Ep. 1046), if the now college
should bc founded within either St.
Donatian’s or the college of Arras.
Josel did not act. See Neve, pp. 49-51‚
382. 'l'o these was afterwards added
Ant. Sucquet 3 cf. de Jongh pp. 13*‚ 17*.

9. duodecim libras] Apparently an
attempt to purchase the post; with a
sum which, from the proposal in Ep.
1046. 27-8‚ must have been about as
much as a year's salary.

12. Abbas] Perhaps some patron
who had contributcd to Barland's sup-
port ; as Henl·y of Bergcn (Ep. 49 in-
trod.) had to Erasmus'. Barland’s
tutorship to Chai-les of Groy, abbot of
Afflighom, seems not- to have begun
till later.
