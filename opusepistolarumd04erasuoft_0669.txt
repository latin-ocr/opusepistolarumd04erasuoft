EPPENDORFF'S COPY OF EPISTOLAE AD DIVERSOS 619

incorrect—a hasty inference into which, from the frequent vilifica-
tion of Egmondanus‚ it was easy for Eppendorff to fall—-, it may be
presumed that most of the seraps of information are authentic, some
(Nos. 5, 7, 24) being probably derived from Erasmus himself. It is
the more to be regretted that Eppendorff did not read, or at least
annotate, the letters more thoroughly: for not one in twenty has his
comments. After the breach he continued for a time to write
hostile animadversions on Erasmus ; but it appears that he soon lost
interest in this. If there is any truth in the insinuation that he was
in difficulties for money, he was doubtless glad enough to dispose of
a book, the author of which he now detested‚ for some part of the
gold orown which it had eost: and thus it was in the second-hand
book market for Stibarus to buy a few years later.
