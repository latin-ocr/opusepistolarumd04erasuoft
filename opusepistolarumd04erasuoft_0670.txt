APPENDIX XV

THE HEINE COLLECTION

Amore the notes of the late Dr. Max Reich of Berlin, which the
Delegates of the Olarendon Press were good enough to purchase in
1905 for the purpose of this edition, was a letter of Professor Linz‚
dated 1900, enclosing a list of a collection of letters formed in Spain
in 1846—7, by Dr. Gotthold Heine of Berlin. This young scholar,
as Dr. Ernst Orous 01 Berlin kindly discovered for me in 1913,
died on 22 March 1848, 111 1115 twenty-eighth year, as the result of
a chance bullet-wound received four days before during the Revolu-
11011.1 While travelling 111 Spain and Portugal he had written
reports of his progress, which were printed in the Serapezmz. ;2 and
he had brought back With him a great number of papers, some
copied and others boughtfi Before his untimely death a few first-
fruits had been 11111111511οᾰ,4 11111 of the collection of letters now
1ο be considered no use had been made, nor is there any mention
of it in his reports. It passed into the hands of the celebrated
Dr. Dollinger, the leader 01 1110 Old Catholics3 and later on to his
successor, Professor Friedrich. In the summer of 1907 Professor
Friedrich most obligingly placed the letters in our hands at Munich‚
and gave us opportunity 10 examine them at· 10151110, with permission
to copy and publish such as we desii-ed.

The collection contained twenty-four letters in 011, 111 11νο sections
—seven copied by Heine himself‚⁵ and seventeen by an earlier hand,
very neat and careful, perhaps a Spanish copyist of the seventeenth
or eighteenth century. The originals of the seven letters copied by
Heine are to be found in a volume of manuscripts now, and 111011,
belonging to the Royal Academy of History at 11101111ε1ε6 and as
Heine notes against his first copy that the address was written by
Erasmus himself, the rest of the letter being by a secretary, it may
reasonably be insen-ed that it was copied directly from the Madrid
autogr-aph⁷ which has just the condition he describes.
