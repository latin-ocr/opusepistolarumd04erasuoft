244 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1520

10²³51095n39 FRoM WILLIBALD PIRCKHMMER.

Nuremberg MS. PP. 33 (a). Nuremberg.
ΕΑΕ. f0. a² (6¹): Essv. p. 149 (βῖ). 30 April (1520).
F. p. 478: HN: Lond. xii. 12: LB. 561 and 504.

[There are two texts of this letter ; one in Pirckheimer’s autograph rough-draft,
preserved in the Town Library at Nuremberg (a), the other printed in the Ap-
pendix to ΕΑΕ (βῑ) and then in Eizv (3²) from the letter actually sent and received,
and subsequently reprinted in F and later editions. The relation of these
clearly is that α is prior in composition to βι and 3² ( = β) ; but as these represent
the actual letter dispatched, that is to say the text finally adopted by Pirckheimer,
they must have precedence of α. Accordingly Ι have taken βι for the text here,
and have placed the variants of α 111 the notes: not, however, reproducing
divergences of spelling or order. The variants recorded are quite sufficient to
illustrate Pirckheimer's practice, at any rate in his rough—drafts, of writing
many words with single instead of double consonants. It may be noted that
some of the vigorous expressions of α are toned down in B. The text of a was
lirst printed by Goldast in P. p. 402, not very accurately3 and from this source
Leclerc reprinted it as LB. 561, with a note that its substance is the same as LB.
504 (based on β). For F it might have been expected that 13², as a Froben volume,
would serve as the original: but seemingly not, for when B¹ and [3² vary, F
almost always follows β1 (cf. Ep. 1109).

The year-date can be assigned from the appearance of Lee’s Annotatioues (Ep.
1037) (c. Feb. 1520), which Pirckheimer has seen3 and from the inclusion of
the letter in Env, Aug. 1520.

A point ofinterest is that in α Pirckheimer has written hastily against the
heading—evidently a remark that suggested itseIf, te be added—the words:
‘Guielmus Nesenus tibi Lei scripta misit'. The Bodleian possesses a volume
(Mar. 869) containing Lee’s Annotationes, Paris, Gourmont, (c. Feb. 1520), and
Erasmus· Apoloyia qua respondet, Antwerp, M. HiHen, (c. March> 1520 (Ep. 1037
introd.), and, bound between them, Erasmus’ first Reffloneio, ibid.. April 1520:
the binding being perhaps contemporary. On the title-page of Lee's book are
two autograph inscriptions by Resch and Nesen : at the foot ‘Ex dono Com-adi
Resch. Ad Guielmum Nesenum ', with the second clause subsequently erased;
and at the top ‘Nesenus clarissimo Bilibaldo '. On the title-page of the Apoloyz'a
qua respondet is written in Nesen's hand ‘Doctissimo Bilibaldo Pyrchem(ero)
Nesenu<s> ⁷, in two lines with the ends shorn off in binding. It seems clear that
this is the volume of which Pirckheimer was thinking. If so, tibi in his note
must be interpreted as the Ethic Dative.]
