414 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1520

ferme iter equitauimus soli3 latronem nullum vidimus, etiamsi

15 multos terrebant saeui rumores.

Tu vero quid isthic rerum geris? Iamne satis Germanice spiras ‘?
Quomodo te beant aestuaria Germanica ‘? Ο te felicem, qui in media
bruma fruaris aestate! Sed quid tandem agit amasius tuus Cicero ’.Ρ
Quae spes habet te fore vt ille totus aliquando reuiuiscat‘? Verum

20 etiam atque etiam vide ne sic adames M. Tullium vt cum Hieronymo
flagris liuentes scapulas referas. Rides somnium? at expertus ille
somnium esse negat. Sed ego, mi Augustine, serio iam laudo
studium tuum qui totus in Cicerone verseris. Quod idem si fecissem,
fortasse meliorem gratiam retulissent ingenia candidiora, quam nunc

25 referunt quidam, quibus benefacere periculosissimum est.
Breui me reddam vestro contubernio. Interim salutabis meis

verbis mitissimum Saeuerum, congerronem tuum, et insignem heroa
Aloysium Marlianum, Tudensem episcopum. Bene vale.

[The year-date given in H is as fanciful as most of those added in that edition
to letters of the earlier periods: for Ep. 867, which was the cause of the trouble,
was not written till 1518. Moreover, though Ep. 867 was shown in ms. to
numerous friends (cf. Epp. 877. 32-3, 878. 8-9, 879. 16, 880.6-8‚ 881. 3—4, 882.2-3,
883. 2—3‚ 885. 31-2, 886. 11—12, 887. 2-3‘), including the Count of Neuenahr, who
had given Erasmus his introduction (cf. Ep. 867. 111), it probably did not
attract the notice of the Canons of Aachen until its appearancein E, c. Nov. 1519
(sec Ep. 1040 introd.).

The changes in Ep. 867 made in F may certainly be attributed to the remon-
strances which Erasmus answers here ε so that this letter cannot be later than
1521. The coincidence of 11. 17—18 with the passage substituted in F suggests that
this letter was written about the time when Erasmus was revising Ε for the new
edition (see p. 390). It may be placed conjecturally in December 1520, after his
visit to Aachen mentioned in Ep. 1169. On such an occasion he might well
have heard hints of dissatisfaction with the language of Ep. 867. The words
‘vetus vlcus refricuisse' (1. 6) suggest that the question had been raised before;
and show also that this letter must be placed as late as possible within the limits
of time indicated. For Priccard see Ep. 972 inti-od]
