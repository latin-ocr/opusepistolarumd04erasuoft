[This letter came to Merula in a copy made from the original autograph. The
manuscript belonged to Gt. Philip of Hohenlohe-Neuenstein, in the N. of Wur-
temberg3 and the copy was furnished by his secretary, I. de Groot. It reached
Merula when his book was well advanced in printing 3 and was inserted,
evidently in an attempt after chronological arrangement, on a separate sheet of
two folios (LL), the page-numeration‚ 89-92‚ being repeated : without, however,
any distinction from the proper numeration which follows Merula's note traces
the descent of Gt. Philip’s wife from Maximilian of Bul-en (l. 81n); and thus
suggests that the letter after receipt may have been given by Alexander to the
boy to treasure.

Herminjard (33) 111 printing an extract from this letter, changes the month-
date to 13 May—an easy correction—‚ following Merula in referring Charles'
mandate (l. 6611) 10 the Imperial Edict of 8 May (see Ep. 1217. 14411), instead of
to the Mechlin proclamation. But Erasmus' lang-uage may quite well apply to
anticipations ; and from the opening of the Diet Aleander had been endeavour-
ing to secure a prompt issue of an Edict (Creighton v. 147). So, whichever
interpretation is accept-ed⁷ the date may stand as shown by Merula: though note
should be made of the resemblance in ll. 21—3 to the passage about Luther 111
Ep. 1202. 220—3, written afterthe appearance of the Paris 'Determinatio on 15 April.

Alexander Schweiss († a. 2 Nov. 1536) of Herborn is only known from this
date onwards; though 116 is perhaps the youth to whom Erasmus took a fancy
111 1520 (Ep. 1119. 1). 111 1522 116 accompanied Ct. Henry of Nassau to Spain ;
where he was raised to the nobility by Charles v, 23 June 1523, and 011 26 Aug.
1524 was appointed an Imperial Secretary at Valladolid (CaballerQ pp. 309, 357).
Some letters from him, 1526-9, to Ct. Wm. of Nassau (Ep. 147. 58n) are printed
by J. Arnoldi in Εἶπον-160116 Denkwiirdiqlceiten, 1817, pp. 222-6; others to Pirck-
heimer, 1526-30, are in P. pp. 265, 264, 330, cf. p. 398. In Charles' service he
took part in the negotiations for the settlement ofreligious difficulties at Piacenza
and Augsburg, 1529-30. In 1533 he 1611 the Chancery 3 where he was suc-
ceeded by Matthias Held. See ADB. He is mentioned in the preface to Peter
Apianus' Quadrans astrononzicus, Ingelstadt, 6 J uly 1532]

Peter (Ep. 3) was perhaps still living ;
and 111 Ep. 330.10-13 there is mention of
a relation. Besides these another kins-

notice by my friend. Dr. William Hunt.
