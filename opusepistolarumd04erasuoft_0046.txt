[The present application may have been suggested to Erasmus by Claudius
Cantiuncula3 for there is reason to suppose that they had met at Basle in the
summer of 1518 (Ep. 852. 77—81). I cannot find that the library yielded him
any manuscripts. He was perhaps inquiring on behalf of cyprian (Ep. 1000).

At Metz, as in the other sees of Lon-aine, the Cathedral Chapter was presided
over by a Primieerius‚ who ranked above the Dean. The present holder of the
office was Nicholas Tussanus (·l·5 Aug. 1520, at Rome), who from Canon and
Almoner had been appointed Primicerius⁷ 22 Nov. 1505. The Dean was Olricus
des Hazards, who had been canon 17 Jan. 1509, dean 4 Nov. 1514, and died
17 June 1527 (GC. xiii. 809, 813).

The see was at this time awakening under the advent of its youthful bishop,
John of Lorraiue (9 April 1498-10 May 1550), a younger son of Duke Rene 11.
Papal regulations required that a man should be 27 before he could be conse·
crated a bishop. But in 1500, in defiance of all propriety, John had been
appointed coadjutor to his uncle⁷ the reigning bishcp; and when the uncle
died, 20 Oct. 1505, the see was kept open until John should reach an age at
which the Pope might be induced to relax the requiremen-t. On 19 Oct. 1517
John was created Bishop of Toul, on his twentieth birthday he was admitted to
Metz, and on 28 May 1518 he was made Cardinal 3 see Ciaconius iii. 418292 GC. xiii.
