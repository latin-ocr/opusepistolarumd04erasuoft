Ῑ 1037] FROM EDWARD LEE 111

³ cited in Ep. 1118. 611, some of which were written when the book must have
been in the press, shows that Erasmus was still feeling sore. Of the preparation

’ of EEV„ published in Aug. 1520, Erasmus was perhaps not cognizant: see Ep.

1083 introd. The combatants met at Calais in J uly 1520, with a show of amity
(Ep. 1132. 18n). But after that Lee disappears for a time from Erasmus'

ᾗ correspondence, until in 1525 the attacks made on the critical scholar by estab-

 

lished orthodoxy encouraged Lee, who was now in contact with Spanish theo·
logians, to renew the conflict. For Erasmus' opinion of Lee by that time, cf.
Ep. 1581. A very full account of the whole controversy is given by A. Bludau,
Die beiden ersten Erasmus-Ausqaben des Neuen Testaments, 1902, pp. 86-125.

For the defence of Erasmus by his friends see Epp. 998. 6611, 1083 introd.;
and for original copies of Lee’s book and Erasmus' Apologia qua respondet see Ep.
1 introd.

0{sprecise date is not possible for this preface. It may have been composed as
early as April 1519, when Lee made his first endeavours to have the book printed

at Antwerp, but it may equally well be assigned to the later date, when the
book actually appeared.]

1038. To ERARD DE LA MAROK.

Epistolae ad diuersos p. 498. (Louvain.)
HN : Lond. xii. 29: LB. 372. <October fin. 1519.)

[From the description of the cup sent by the Archbishop of Mainz this letter
clearly is contemporary with Ep. 1033 ; from the mention of the attitude of the
leading Councillors it must be of the same period as Ep. 1040.

The events alluded to here and in Ep. 1040 may therefore be explained as
follows: that the Bishop of Liege, on his way to Brussels, had recently passed
through Louvain (shortly before 17 Oct.: cf. Ep. 1030. 63-4), and that Erasmus
had visited him there, but had omitted to go again and take leave before the
Bishop's departure ; that subsequently Erasmus heard from a friend among the
theologians at Louvain, perhaps Dorp, of the reports spread about him at
Brussels by Hochstrat, and accordingly judged it expedient to pay a visit to
Court (Epp. 1040. 1, 1041. 25) to dispel unfavourable impressions. It may be
conjectured that at the same time he went on to Antwerp, and appeared there
in time to upset Hillen's second agreement with Lee (Ep. 1061. 608n)⁷ which was
made in October or November. The expedition must be placed either before or
after 1 Nov. (Ep. 1039), and this letter evidently precedes it, Epp. 1040-1 follow
it. As Epp. 1040—1 can hardly be dated before the second half of the mouth, it
seems better to place Erasmus' visit to Brussels and Antwerp in November
rather than in October.

It may well have been on the occasion of Erard de la Marck’s presence in
Louvain in October that the theologians sent three Masters to inquire whether
it were true that he was favourably inclined towards Luther, as stated by
