Daniel Tayspil († 17 June 1533) of Neuve Eglis e x. of 41 mentiere (or. ‘² Nieu-
kerken „Waes) joined the Praemonstratensians of St. Augustine' s near Ter ouenne
(GC. iii. 539). Being appointed Suffragan to Francis of Melun, bp. of Terouenne
(†22 Nov. 1521), hes assumed the customary title of bp. of Gibel in poribus (cf.
Ep. 130. 63n). In 1524 he was elected Abbot of Wormeze1‚a house of Austin
canons, s. of Ypres (GC. v. 351)· 7 the chronicle of which (see Recz‹.z'l cle θὴν-ο oniq tes
(Ze la Flandre, 1e seiz, Bruges, 1847, pp. 14, 15) describes him as interested in
learning, and strict in enforcing discipline. EE2. 111, where the date of his
death is given as 20 June, speaks of him as ⁴<Erasmi> amantissimus ³, and as
knowing Latin and Greek. Peter Tayspil‚ who was President of the Couneil of
Flanders in 1527, was perhaps a kinsman.]

1233. 99n. Erasmus was doubtless

Gabbai3 and had received encourage-
ment from Adrian de Castello, as well

thinking of the contrast with More
himself and Mountjoy: to whom he
was perhaps now writing (Ep. 1219).
cf. also his frequent eulogies of the
English Court (Ep. 999. 221n).

Calabro oppido Roccha Coragii‘‚ ap-
parently Catanzar0; author of Gram-
matica Hebraicae linquae, 51. et n. (c.

he found protection from the Governor,
Jo. Nicolai, bp. of Apu and in 1530
was appointed to one of the Hebrew
