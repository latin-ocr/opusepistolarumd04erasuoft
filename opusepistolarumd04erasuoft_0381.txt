1138] ΤΟ WILLIAM BURBANK 333

william Burbank‚ or Smythson, (1,- 1531) entered at Cambridge as a student
of Civil Law in 1495-6 (Camb. Gracc Book B. i, p. 82). When he met Erasmus at
Rome in 1509, he was secretary to Card. Bainbridge; and so remained till the
Cardinal’s death in 1514, when with Pace he acted as executor. He returned to
England with 3 strong recommendation to Henry VI11 (Brewer i. 5349 : 22 Aug.
1514); and by 1516 was chaplain and secretary to VVolsey, and prothonotary
apostolic. When Wolsey visited Cambridge in 1520, Burbank was made Dr. of
canon Law (Camb. G‘race Book B. ii, p. 78).

Like his friend Tones (l. 16n) he attested many important documents, and
served WVolsey in the survey of monasteries to be converted to the foundation of
Cardinal College, Oxford3 and in 1529 he enjoyed the King's confidence also
(Brewer iv. 5783). His preferment included two prebends at York‚ 1512 and
1524, 311(1 0110 31 Lincoln, 1518 (Le Neve iii. 185, 218, ii. 236); and 1110 31011-
deaconry of Carlisle‚ 1520 (Le Neve iii. 2493 cf. Brewer iii. 741).

1521-2, and till 1527 prebendary of Salisbury (Ath. Oaeaem. i. 400), 15 probably
