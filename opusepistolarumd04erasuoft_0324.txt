278 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1520

Metsys' pertrait of Gilles (Ep. 584. 6 ; cf. Ep. 684. 14n), it is evident that
shortly after Erasmus' arrival at Louvain he had already recovered the ms. of
book i (cf. Ep. 706. 32n)—which was based (cf. ll. 47-8) on the draft originally com-
posed at Halsteren (see vol. i, p. 588)—, and had formed the design of printing it.
On 1 Jan. 1519 he was still desiderating the 115. left with Pace in Italy <L 39n) ;
see Luc. Iud„ where among ⁴ nondum aedita et imperfecta ’ he mentions ⁴ Anti-
barbari : quod opus pene puer coeperat, mox mutato argumento vertit in dialo-
gum. Denique duos libros Bononiae recognouit ac locupletauit. Exemplar bis
descriptum deposuit apud amicum quendam, vnde nondum potuit recipere '.
But as nothing more reached him, he proceeded to print book i separately, with
the title, Antibarbarorum D. Erasmz' Rom-odam liber vaus, quem iuuenis quidem adhuc
lusit, caeterum diu desideratum, demum repertum 'non iuuenisrecoynom't et velut postliminio
studz‘osis restitnit. Ex quo reliquorum, qui diis propicz‘is propediem accedent, lector con-
iacturam facias licebit: Basle, Froben, May 1520 (a). By 1523 110 had acquired the
beginning and end of book ii, the former from England, the latter from Bruges
(1, p. 34. 11-13). But his subsequent researches seem to have been without
success: at any rate he published nothing more of the work. That a part of
book ii should have come to him from England is in accord with the existence
of a much more complete MS.. which Ascham saw at- Cambridge in 1550 : see his
letter (iii. 13) to Jerome Froben, 10 June (1551).

The work itself was delivered to the Frobens in Basle 0. April 1520 (Zw. Ε.2
131 z cf. BRE. 165). But this preface is probably to be dated later than the
colophon 3 for by 25 May it had not arrived in Basle, though the rest of the book
was set up (BRE. 166) 3 and even on 22 July all was not yet ready for publication
(Zw. Ε.2 148). This inference is corroborated by the composition of the first
sheet (A) where the verso of the title is blank, the preface fills only ff. ΑΞ, ΑΒ,
and fo· Α4 again is completely blank, the book beginning with sheet B—-an
arrangement which implies that sheet A was set up later, and also 111 some
haste, without any attempt to fill the vacant pages with subsidiary matter.
Copies of the book had been sent to Schlettstadt for Beatus Rhenanus and Sapidus
before 1 1 Aug. (BRE. 174‘2 3 and by 26 Sept. Alciati had seen it at Avignon (Gudic'
Epistolae, ed. C. Burmann, 1697, p. 80). At first it sold so well that Froben
reprinted it, without change in this preface, in Dec. 1520 ; but the only other
authorized editions by the Froben firm are of Aug. 1535 (B), and in vol. ix of the
Basle, Opera, 1540 (γ). BEr.² describes also unauthorized issues at Deventer,
Gologne, and Strasburg. From E1·asmus“ statement here (ll. 48-51) that he had
taken the book in hand in order to anticipate publication by others, it follows
that the Cologne edition of 1518 reported from the Bibliotheque Mazarine, but
not now discoverable (see BE1·.²), must be 3 figment: arising perhaps from a
misreading of the colophon of the edition of 1523.

For criticism of the book from the side of the orthodox theologians see Ep.
1 166. 26n.]

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS IOANNI SAPIDO SVO S. D.

MIRAM quandam esse naturae vim atque ἐνέργειαν vel hinc colligo,
Sapide charissime, quod cum me puero prorsus exularent ludis
literar-iis bonae literae, cum deessent librorum ac praeceptorum
subsidia, cum nullus honos adderet ingenio calcar, imo cum passim
5 omnes ab his studiis deterrerent et ad alia compellerent, me tamen
non iudicium, quod mihi tum per aetatem esse non poterat, sed
naturae sensus quidam ad Musarum sacra velut afflatum rapiebat.
Inuisos habebam quoscunque noueram humanioribus studiis infensos ;
adamabam quos eadem delectabant 3 qui in his aliquid opinionis sibi
10 parassent, eos ceu numina quaedam venerabar ac suspiciebam. Huius
animi 110 50110111 quidem adhuc poenitet. Non quod aliorum studia
damnem, quae mihi non perinde placuerunt. sed quod intelligam
quam frigida, manca caecaque sit eruditio, si quis Musarum detrahat
praesidia. Caeterum dictu pudendum quam hanc longe optimam
