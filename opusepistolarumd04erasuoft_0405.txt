[The group of letters, Epp.1149-52‚ 1156, was written to introduce to members
of the Imperial Court a Dominican of whom Erasmus at this time held a high
opinion, John Faber of Augsburg (c. 1470-1530), M. A. and D. D. Before long, in
August 1523,110 wrote of him differently· ‘Is qualis nunc sit nescio: certe mihi
Louanii persuasit quod institueret Augustae collegium tradendis linguis ac bonis
literis ; ostendit diploma Caesaris Maximiliani. De capitalibus quibusdam
inimicis Lutheri atque de ipsa Romana curia plusquam hostiliter loquebatur.
Arridebat morum commoditas, et in sua theologia videbatur non vulgariter
eruditus. His rebus extorsit a me commendationes aliquot. Quin et Coloniae,
cum illic esset Caesar, colebat nos, et de Luthero reliquit aequissimum iudicium
sua manu descriptum tum apud Cardinalem Moguntinum, tum apud me '
(Spongia, LB. x. 1648AB = HE. 333, ξ 158).

Faber's theologieal studies had been eompleted in Italy3 and after taking his
degree, probany at Padua, he returned in 1508 to Augsburg. He was appointed
Prior of his house ; an office which he held for 17 years, and in course of which
he rebuilt their chureh, 1512-15. In 1511 he was elected Vicar-General of
Upper Germany‚ and held office until 1524. Maximilian made him his coun-
cillor, and proposed to us e him in the foundation of a new monastery and
a t1ilingual college at Augsburg. Apa1t from the Consilium mentioned below,
Fabers only published work is two funeral orations, 011 Gas1 Jar de Silinon,
captain of the Pope' s Swis s Guard, 26 Aug. 1517 (S. l. et α. ), and on Maximilian,
16 Jan.1519 (Augsburg, Grimm, July 1519).

In his present visit to Court he had more than one object. He wished to
obtain protection from the observ ant section of his Order, who for some years
past had been trying to impose on his house a strict‘ reformation' , without
consideration of the learning which he had much at heart (cf. Ηο11111·1·1111,Ρ.87).
He wished also to have his appointment as councillor renewed under Charles,
and to secure the 1Ηονο131011 to the see of Tr,ent which had been promised to him
by Maximilian. Besides this he brought with him a proposal for settling the
Lutheran t1 ouble urging both sides to Omoderation. When Erasmus saw this at
Cologne, it was still 111 ms. ;but it was shortly afterwards printed with the title
Consilium cuiusdam ex animo cupientis esse consultum et Ro. Pontificis cligmitali et Chri-
stianae reliyionis tranquillitati. Five editions in Latin are known—one with the
date 1521—and four in German: see L. Geiger in Aiffch f. Litteramryesch. v (1876),
pp. 555,6‚ andG. Finsler, Zwinqli Bibliogsraphie, 1897, pp. 80- 82 In the Bodleian,
4o B 9 Th. Seld„ is an issue with -1 different title, Consilium doctissimi cuiusdam,
mayno‘rum Principum monitu praecipue acl hoc munus inuitati . . . It was soon
suspected that Erasmus was the author (Ep. 1199. 31-4 ; cf. VE. 247, and LE2.
435. 34-7‚ where Luther has no doubt on the subject ς also a dispatch of Aleander,
Balan p. 1043 and Lond. xxvii. 2, LB. 1195); and this suspicion, which he
never directly denies, has been commonly accepted in modern times. The fact
that many passages in his letters of this period <Epp. 1143. 69-70, 76-7, 1144. 4,
1153. 152—3, 1167. 343-7‚ 1173. 42-5, 1183. 38-40, 1219. 35—6) appear almost verbally
in the Consilium, and the coincidence of Ep. 1199. 31—ss with Ep. 1217. 35-56, leaves
no doubt as to his complicity (cf. also Ep. 1267. 17n) z but it must be noticed
that the sentence quoted from Faber in Ep. 1156. 50-54 is also in the Consilium,
and that Erasmus expressly ascribes the document to him in Ep. 1217 and in
the Sponyia, supra. An easy and likely explanation is that, as Faber had brought
his scheme with him in ms., Erasmus, after their frequent conversations at
Louvain and Cologne (Ep. 1156. 8-9), rewrote the central part, in which the
resemblances to his letters occur : so that the Consilium as finally launched was
a. joint production. P. Kalkoff (Arch. s. RejZ-Gesch. i, 1903, pp. 6-23)‚ in view of
the coincidence of the Consilium with Erasmus' general outlook, ascribes to him
a preponderant part in it: considering that he found Faber to be in agreement
with him, and so made use of him asa convenient instrument for the circulation
of his own ideas. In 1526 Erasmus wrote, no doubt in reference to this occa-
sion, ‘Ostendi viam finiendi mali, reiectum est consilium' (Ep. 1690ρι cs. also
Ep. 1526 of 12 Dec. 1524.
