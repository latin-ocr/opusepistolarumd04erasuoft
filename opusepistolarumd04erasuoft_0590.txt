veritati Euangehcae, neque dignitati Romani Pontificis, cum licebit.
Et fortassis plus adferam momenti quam ii qui putant his tumultibus
rem posse confici. Illud nobis videndum, ne sic oderimus Lutherum
vt illius odio perdamus et ea quae sunt optima3 et ita sei-uiamus
dignitati nostrae vt non laedamus autoritatem Euangelicae veritatis,
et ita faueamus hominum gloriae ne quid officiamus gloriae Christi.
In me interim si quid habetis, ne agite conuiciis, quemadmodum
nuper apud Rectorem Rosemundanum egit Egmondanus, et nunquam
non agit Vincentius. Argumentis agite, et satisfaciam vobis per
omnia. Quod si voletis officiis certare, non patiar me vinci. Sin
erunt qui malint maleficiis contendere, non contendam quidem in
hoc genere vincere 3 sed tamen conabor meam innocentiam defendere,
nec puto defutura praesidia Christi ac bonorum virorum. Bene
valete, domini reuerendi et fratres in Christo obseruandi.
Ex Anderlaco. An. M.D.xxx.

British Museum MS„ Harl. 6989, f. 5. Brussels.
Jortin ii. 396: LB. 583. 5 July 1521.

[An original letter, autograph throughout: now 111 the British Museum, as
part of the collection formed by Robert Harley, earl of Oxford {gt- 1724). It was
first printed by Τ. Crenius (T. T. Crusius) in his Anc'mccslzcers. philol„ Leideu,
1699,v. 238, and then by J. W. van Meel in an appendix to Hotomanorum Epistolae,
Amsterdam, 1700, p. 427. To both editors (Crenius p.' 238 ; van 'Meel f0. 212⁴, νο)
it had been communicated by the young J. Burkhard Menkenius of Leipzig
(ΑΕΒ. xxi. 310), who with 3 friend, G. F. Schutz, had been travelling in Eng-
land in 1698. But the text as they print it, is clefective; for the variants show
that Menkenius' transcript was made not ‘ ex autographo ⁹, as Crenius states, but
from a xvii0. copy which accompanies it in the Harleian volume (f. 6), and which
though often inaccurate, is more easily decipherable. As Hal-ley's first consider-
able purchase of books was made in 1705 (DNB. xxiv. 405), it seems likely that
this manuscript was not in his hands when Menkenius saw it.

For LB. Lec1erc was supplied with another copy. made—it is not evident
whether from the original or its copy, or from Menkenius’ transcript—by
Sebastian Kortholt, professor of eloquence at Kiel. Leclerc accepts his readings,
which vary from van Meel’s printed text in many places: but they are not
always more correct. These variants need not be reproduced here, for the
original does not admit of any doubt.

The manuscript year-date is quite clear : it is confirmed by the resemblances
to Epp. 1221, 1236. In Ep. 1342. 64-5 Erasmus says that after Charles' return
from Germany to Brussels (where he arrived on 14 June) ί propemodum magis
habitabam Bruxellae quam Anderlaci ⁷. In view of this, the fact that this letter
is dated. from Brussels and Ep. 1221 from Anderlecht on the same day, creates no
discrepancy. Pace was now with the King at Windsor.
