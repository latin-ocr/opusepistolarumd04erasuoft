ADDENDA xxiii

P. 510, Ep. 260. Melanchthon's appreciation of the De Copia is shown by two
prefaces that he wrote (ME. 653, 1214), one for an abridgement 0. 1529,
1110 011101 for an edition of 1534.

P. 515, Ep. 263. 21n. The Bodleian has two volumes of Luther’s works
(TL. 18. 10 and 15) presented to Mich. Hummelberg in 1522 (one on
11 Nov.) by the Adelmanns of Augsburg: the Vom Eelichen Leben,
Wittemberg, 1522, and Wicler den falschqenanten gaystlichen stand des Bagam,
s. 1.‚ 1522. Besides inscribing his name on the last leaf of each, in
the latter Hummelberg has copied a short letter 1ο him from Thomas
Blaurer, 15 Sept. (1522 5³), which seems to be unpublished.

P. 528, Ep. 270. 6011. The Library of Queen's College, Oxford, possesses a
Biblia Latina, Paris, R. Stephanus, 1528 (252. C. 12), with the autograph
inscription ‘Thomas Lupsett ‘ twice on the title-page.

P. 533, Ep. 275. 511. 111 the Library 01· Peterborough Cathedral (E. 1. 17) is
a copy of Ovid’s Μείανηοψῖῑοεθε, Lyons‚ C. Davost, 22 Oct. 1504, which
belonged to John VVatson.

P. 557, Ep. 291. 311. 0116 Nov. 1525 Dr. Augustinus Aggeus was sent to England
by Charles of Gueldres as envoy to Henry v111 ε Brewer iv. 1746.

P. 563, Ep. 295. 25. Sir John Paston in 1473 (no. 725) considered a riall
enough to take a man from London to Calais.

P. 564, Ep. 296 introd. The Francis of Nymegen to whom Erasmus showed
Ep. 296 is very likely to be identified with Ger-ard Geldenhauer (Ep.
487), who was a Crucifer at Louvain, and in 1517 became chaplain to
Philip of Burgundy, bp. of Utrecht : Lypsius having made a mistake in
the Christian name, as Erasmus did so often (cf. Ep. 1054 introd.).

P.608‚ 1711. Dr. A. A. J. Karthon of Heusden has made an important
discovery in the Library of the Prov. Genootschap van Kunsten en
VVetenschappen at Hertogenbosch: of the source from which Leclerc
printed the 19 letters concerned with Erasmus' Gouda friends, and,
in his vol. viii, Erasmus’ early poems. It is a ms. volume written in
1570 by a hand which has not been identified3 and later it belonged
to Peter Scriverius. It contains 61 letters in two books, and of these
42 were printed by Merula in 01. As the remaining 19 are similar
in character to the rest, it seems hardly likely that Merula can have
had them before him. It may therefore be conjectured that he was
using for his volume, not this 113. of 1570, but the originals from which
it was copied, and that for some reason he overlooked the nineteen:
further, that the ns. did not come into Scriverius' possession until after
the publication of 0² in 1615—though it should be noted that he did not
print the letters from the 113. which appear in Ol.

Dr. Karthon has printed the results of his exainination of the 113. in
Hec Beck, 1916, 113-293 with two faesimiles, one of which proves con-
clusively that the 113. was in the hands of Leclerc or De Ia Faye for LB.
His collation shows that, apart from Leclerc’s standard orthography, in
11 out of the 19 letters there are no variants between the 1113. and LB. ;
in the remaining 8 he records the following readings of the 1113. :

Ep. 6. 7. negotius. Ep. 27. 2. fructus.

Ep. 12. 5. respondent. Ep. 35. 7. existimo qui.
Ep. 19. 18-19. subinuidens. 97. imbarbes.
Ep. 21. 20. eredunt. Ep. 37. 4. fecerant.

72. notari. Ep. 38. 27. proficiscitur.

He also notes that in Ep. 83. 42 for saepe madere cogebamur vel ralelzcdz'nis
studio the ns. reads assidue madebam, rel valetudini ; but that in the other
41 letters printed in Οι 1110 MS. agrees closely with Merula's text.

It appears that the MS. has been in the Hertogenbosch Library since
1872-33 but of its intermediate history since it was used by Leclerc,
Dr. Karthon has not yet discovered any indications.
