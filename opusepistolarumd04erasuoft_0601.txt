1222] FROM JOHN LOUIS VIVES 551

consilium tuum propemodum noui, vt parem ocium ad vitam studio· 20
sam vndecunque queam. Quod, cum alia praestitero omnia, non est
in manu mea praestare : quod si in eo solo sita est fortuna, non est
suae quisque fortunae faber, vt dicebat Appius.

Habes quae hactenus egerim, quaeque sim breui acturus. Scio
quae subeat animum tuum cogitatio: de Augustino quid? Sex 25
libros habeo paratos, hoc est recognitos; nam alii permulti sunt
scripti: quos sex possem mittere, si qui exscriberet haberem. Caete-
rum si non mittantur hoc Augusto, mittentur ante hyemem, vt spero.
Scit Deus quantum ea res me angat; sed vis me θεομαχεῖνῗ) Malui
differre Augustinum quam vel immori labori, vel euadere inutilem 30
aliis laboribus, oppressum morbis et sine vlle instrumento vitae.
Haec enim recuperare difficile possem semel amissa; illum dilatum
facile erit in manus sumere, cum volam. Rogo te etiam atque
etiam vt, si non vel tempori vel sorti vel fato imputandam hanc

culpam censes, mihi saltem hanc facias huius errati gratiam, si qui· 35
dem per me erratum.

Πέμπω πρὸς σὲ καὶ παροιμίας ἄλλας, quae inter legendunl occurrerunt.
Fac vt per hunc eundem qui has ad te pertulit, rescribas nobis, si
modo vacat: et si scripto aut non potes aut non vis, verbo certe
effice vt de tua valetudine statuque rerum tuarum intelligam, quas 40
ego non minus charas habeo curoque quam meas. Vale, praeceptor
(mortalium) omnium chariss<in1e>. Brugis x. Iulii, 1521.

[The gap of between five and six weeks in Erasmus* correspondence at this
point is perhaps due to hard work (ef. Ep. 1218. 17-19), or to illness—of

which, however, there is no trace—‚ or to the chance which governed the sur-
vival of his letters.

The year-date added here in H is again clearly wrong. 1521 is the only year
possible between More's appointment as Treasurer (ll. 40-45) and the publication
of F. The opening sentences, descanting on the delights of country life, were
probably written at Anderlecht (cf. Ep. 1215. 3-7) ; but the letter was dated, and
perhaps finished, at Bruges, whither Erasmus had moved in discharge of his duties
as Imperial Councillor. Charles was at Bruges 7-26 Aug.. to meet Wolsey ; who
had come over from England to Calais 2 Aug. (Brewer iii. 1458) on a diplomatic
mission, to draw Spain more closely to England in a league against France.
Wolsey arrived at Bruges 14 Aug. (ibid. 1503), and left about the same date as
Charles (ibid. 1510, 1513). with his purpose effected; but he did not return to
England till 28 Nov. (ibid. 1810).

To Erasmus this visit was full of enjoyment. He stayed with his old friend
Marcus Laurinus, moving among the great and receiving special politeness from the
King of Denmark (Ep. 1228. 3011); and some of his leisure was spent in examining
the mss. of St. Donatian's (Ep. 373 introd.). Vives, too, was there, busy with his
work upon Augustino ; see Ep. 1306. 43 and his Aug. Ciu. Dei, f⁰. aa& On 14 Aug„
