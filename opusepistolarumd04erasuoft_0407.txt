[Mercurino Arborio (10 June 1465—5 June 1530) belonged to a good family
resident at Gattinara, or, as he usually writes it, Gattinaria, in Piedmont, sw.
of L. Maggiore. At 13, finding his mother of 27 left a widow with six other
children, and wishing to help her, he betrothed himselfto an orphan of 2ο, who
had been left well provided for; and though for some years the opposition of
relatives was too strong for him, he married her in 1490, and with her consent
and means went to study law at Tun-in, where he made rapid progress and soon
began to practice with success. This attracted the notice of Duke Philibert 01·
Savoy, who in 1501 recommended him as confidential adviser to the Duchess,
Margaret of Austria. When she was appointed to govern the Netherlands,
Gattinara followed her as her minister3 and in 1508 she made him Presi-
dent of the Council of Burgundy. His letters to her in 1507·ss are printed
by L. M. G. Kooperberg‚ Marqaretlza ran Oosfen‘rz'jk, 1908. pp. 337-463. On the
death of Le Sauvage in June 1518, Gattlnara succeeded him as Chancellor of
Castile. and served Charles ably for 12 yearS, until his death at Innsbruck. His
wife died before him, and thus the Popc was able to gratify his desire to become

Α a Cardinal, 13 Aug. 1529.

Scheurl, who met him in Spain in 1519—20‚ extols his friendliness and capa-
city (SE. 213, p. 109). To Erasmus he was an appreciative patron (cf. Ep.
1197; also LB. App. 469), sharing his views of moderate reform, and 111-
viting him to frequent correspondenoe. W'impfeling lauds him as a patron of
learning, Praqmaticae Sanc-tionis Medulla. Schlettstadt, L. Schurer, May 1520, f0. Α3 ;
Corn. Grapheus dedicated to him, 26 June 1520, a poem, Diui Caroli . . . ex Hispanico
in Germaniam reditus, Antwerp, M. Hillen, s. α.; and Sbrulius (Ep. 1159) his
Vaticlm'unz Proici, on the same theme, Augsburg, Grimm and WVyrsung, (c. 1
Sept.) 1520. Peter Martyr, who came from almost the same district of Pied-
mont, corresponded with him intimately, 1518—223 and three of Gatthmra's
letters are in the same collection (Mart. E. 738, 759, 7658).

Many studies of his life have been written. The most recent are by Le Glay,
Me'm. Soc. Lillc, 1847, 1, pp. 183-260, with a pertrait ; and by G. Claretta in Mem.
Reczle Accacl. Toreno, xlviii, 1897, pp. 67—147‚ and Μόνη. Soc. savoisienne, xii, 1898,
pp. 245-344, reviewed by M. Danvila in Boletm Real Acad. Hist, Madrid, xxxv.
1899, pp. 482-94). But by far the most important source is Mercurino’s auto-
biography down to 24 July 1529, recently discovered in his autograph ms. and
admirably edited with other documents by C. Boi-nate in Misc. cli storia Italirma,
grd seiz, xvii, 1915, pp. 231—585. His will, dated 23 July 1529, is printed by
V. Promis in Misc. δίον. Ital. xviii, 1879, pp. 61-147. See also EE.

The date of his death is given from tho inscription on his· tomb at Gattinara,
printed by ciaconius iii. 505.]
