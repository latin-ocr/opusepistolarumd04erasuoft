likely to the summons to Luther to appear before Cajetan at Augsburg
early in October 1518.

P. 423, Ep. 886. 22—3. Tunstall's copy of the New Testament, 1519, on vellum,
is no doubt that which is now in the Library of York Minster. It came
thither with the books of Tob. Matthew, abp. of York, and at one tiine
dean of Durham : where he bought other books which certainly belonged
to Tunstall.

P. 445, Ep. 904. 19n. Of Erasmus' action in preventing the publication of
Lu'ther's works a trace is probably to be found in a letter of Beatus
Rhenanus to Zwingli, from Basle, 19 March 1519 (BRE. 97 =Zw.

P. 534. That Ep. 941 had a similar signatura to Epp. 913, 966 is shown by

P. 562, Ep. 957. 16. 1 owe to the late Mr. Bywater, and again to Pros. A. O.
Clark, the suggestion that by spii-{tosus Erasinus means the πνεύματος
κολοβότης which Plutarch (Dem. 6) attributes to Demosthenes. He uses
the word similarly in the Ecclesiastes, bk. i (LB. v. 782 F): ‘hominem

where the Basle Opera, v. 653, change to spirituosum.

P. 590, Ep. 967. 97nn. Prof. Preserved Smith is of opinion that by the De
consessione Erasmus meant Luther's Instructio pro confessione peccatorum,
which was probably printed 111 1518. Ηο 3150 points out that the
De poenitentia was printed by Grunenberg at Wittenberg in 1518. See
Luther’s Werke, Weimar, 1883, 1. 257, 317.
