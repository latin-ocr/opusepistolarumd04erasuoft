616 APPENDIX XIV

which make it possible to identify the writer. Dr. Carl Roth, of the
University Library at Basle, has kindly supplied me with a photo-
graph of an autograph letter (printed below) from the Amorbaeh
collection ; and this shows conclusively that the earlier hand is that
of Henry of Eppendorff in Meissen (p. 303), and that the name
erased can be read as ‘Henrici Epphendorpii’. This young Saxon
knight's acquaintance with Erasmus had begun at Louvain in 1520
with an exchange of eompliments. He then went to the University
of Freiburg ; but after a somewhat chequered career there, he left in
the spring of 1522 and followed Erasmus to Basle. Intimacy soon
arose between them. For some time he lived in Erasmus' house-
hold; and they went together to constance in Sept. 1522 to stay
with Botzheim. But this accord did not last long. Eppendorff’s
sympathies were with reform. He hated the monks and friars as
cordially as did Erasmus ; but· in action he was prepared to go much
farther. WVhen Hutten transformed Luther's religious protest into
a national crusade for the unification of Germany, Eppendorff caught
eagerly at the inspiriting idea and was for pursuing it with all his
strength. Erasmus’ cautious moderation became distasteful to him ;
and when to this was added in 1523 the breach between Erasmus
and Hutten, ending in bitter reeriminations, Eppendorff was entirely
alienated.

While still at Freiburg he wrote to Boniface Amerbach, 20 March
1522 (Basle MS. G. Π. 29. 107 z the letter mentioned above):

S. Ex te scire cupio, optime Amorbachii‚ an nostri ioci visi sint
Erasmo tam suaues vt eos responso dignetur„ Queso vrgeas vt
scribat, suppresso tamen me instigatore. Apud nostros rumor est
aquilam a vobis e Mediolano agro profligatam, nobis ‘non admodum

5 iucunda noua. Sed quando ita insaniunt principes, velim huius-
modi trophea sepius referrent domum, vt hominibus simul ac
pecunia attrita, miseris mortalibus pace frui tandem concederent!
Verum tu tuos triumphos apud nie effunde liberius.

Epistolas Erasmi cura mihi quam elegantissime apud vos ligari.

10 atque isto nunttio mihi rescribe quid pro illis numerandum sit.
Faciam vt reddita pecunia proximo nunttio ad me veniant. Interim
vale foelicissime ex Friburgo xx Martii M D XXII.

Hem-icus ab Eppendorff.

To this Boniface replied promptly (Basle MS. C. Vla. 73. 204:
23 March), saying: ‘ Erasmum tua comitate tantum abest vt leseris,
vt etiam tibi alioquin deditum reddideris deuinctiorem. Respondebit
literis tuis statim atque nunciorum oportunitate potuerit. . . .
Epistolare concinnatum aureo coronat-o vendi dicit Hieronymus
<Frobenius> ³. The identification of the handwriting makes it clear
that the Seebohm volume is the copy ordered here.

Having obtained the book thus, Eppendorff proceeded to enrich
the margins here and there with notes. These show very evidently
his persona] feelings and prejudices; his hostility to the orthodox
party and its representatives‚ his admiration for Hutten and Luther,
