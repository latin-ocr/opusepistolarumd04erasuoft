112 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1519

Erasmus in Ep. 980. 36-7, which had just reached their ears (Ep. 1033. 2411).-
Τ110 Bishop declared on the word of a priest‚ ‘ Lutheri librum sibi non visum
neque lectum, tantum aberat vt rei periculosae et ignotae faueret’. See
J. Latomus’ preface, 31 Dec. 1520, to his Articulorum Lutherz‘ damnatorum Ratio,
Antwerp, M. Hillen, 8 May 1521 (f0. A of his Opera, Louvain, 1550), and
de Jongh pp. 212—13, 70*-

The tone of easy assurance in this letter seems to imply that Erasmus had
made his peace with Erard at his own interview in Louvain ; indeed, the form
of the Bishop’s reply to the theologians has such a resemblance to Erasmus'
utterances about Luther in Epp. 939, 961, 967, 993, 1033 that the words might
almost have been put into his mouth.

It was perhaps at the same interview that Erard showed to Erasmus a letter
he had received from Aleander at Rome, bringing Ep. 980 to his notice and
making reflections upon Erasmus: see Epp. 1482, 1496.]

ERASMVS ROTEROD. REVERENDO D. D. ERARDO, PRAESVLI
AC PRINCIPI LEODIENSI, S. D.

IAM plus triduum isthuc iturientern me iugis quaedam ac scelera-
tissima nebula domi alligat. Pensare volebam quod hinc nobis
insalutata discesserat tua celsitudo. Medicus tuus in causa fuit, qui
confirmarat te totum illum diem nobiscum futurum. Insignis ille
heros Albertus, Gardinalis Mogontinensis, cuius diuinas dotes tu
nuper cominus es admiratus, mihi poculum dono misit, cum amplum
et graue, tum opere spectandum. Addit se id dare mihi ipsum
fugienti, maiorem experturo benignitatem si mei fecero copiam.
Dignum nimirum munus quod a tali Principe mitteretur-3 sed Erasmus
dignior qui Samiis bibat. Quin et nomen indidit. Ait vocari
‘poculum amoris ⁹, opinor quod e duobus paribus velut osculo
commissis fiat vnum, quoties libet: ex quo qui biberint, protinus
beneuolentia mutua conglutinari. Si vera sunt haec, vtinam theologi
Louanienses ex eo poculo mecum potassent ante annos duos!

Horum opera compertum habeo, D. N. et N. Principum Bergens.
et Comitis Hoechstratensis animos nonnihil a nobis alienatos. Hos,

2. nebula] Cf. Ep. 1016. 511.

3. Medicus] Perhaps the ‘magnus
Adamus’, who was Erard's physician
in 1515 (Al. E. ii. 10, 11, 17, 32) and
accompanied him on his travels. Or
he is possibly to be identified with
Adam, son of J. Bogardus (Ep. 932.
5411), who was M.D. at Louvain 25
May 1512, became a Franciscan 23 Nov.
1525 on his wife's death, and died 23
March 1550. See Val. Andreas, pp.
230-1.

6. cominus] At Frankfort; cf. Ep.
1001. 47n.

poculum] Of. Ep. 986. 34-9.

15. Bergens.] One of these was no
doubt John of Ber-gen (Epp. 737, 952.
623 cf. Epp. 1025 &c.‚ 1040), the other
perhaps the Abbot of St. Bertin's (Ep.
143), of whose good opinion Erasmus
shows himself careful in Ep. 739.
John's nephew, Maximilian (Ep. 953.

2311), 0311 hardly be intended, for he
seems to have been still in Switzer-
land.

16. Hoechstratensis] Antony de La-
laing (c. 1480—2 April 1540) had been
chamberlain to the Archduke Philip,
whom he accompanied to Spain 1501-
3, writing a narrative of the journey,
which is printed by Gaehard, i. 121-
340. Margaret, as Regent, retained his
services, and he became chamberlain
to CharleS. In 1516 he was elected a
Knight ofthe Golden Fleece(de Reiffen-
berg, p. 308), and in June 1518 the
barony of Hoogstraeten, 11. of Turn-

hout, which he had received with his ¹

wife, Isabella of Culembourg, was
raised by Charles to 3 county. In Feb.

1522 110 succeeded Henry of Nassau ’

(Ep. 829. 12n) as Governor of Holland
and Zeeland. By this time he had

become Margaret's trusted adviser and
