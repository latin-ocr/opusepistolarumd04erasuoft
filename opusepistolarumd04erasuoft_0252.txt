208 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 5 20

1082. To HERMANN‚ COUNT OF NEUENAHR.

Viuis Declamationes Syllanae, tit. v0 (a). · Antwerp.
(c. 15 March> 1520.

[A letter which appears at the beginning of Vives⁷ Declamationes Sullanae quinque,
Antwerp‚ M. Hillen⁷ April 1520: followed by a dedication from Vives to Princo
Ferdinand (cf. Ep. 917 introd.) dated from Louvain. It is noticeable that for a
subsequent edition, which I have only seen as reprinted in his Opera, Basle, Nic.
Episcopius, Aug. 1555, Vives rewrote his dedicatiom adding the date 1520 and
stating that the book was published at the suggestion of Erasmus and other
friends.

This letter is to be dated shortly after the appearance of Lee's book (see Ep.
1037 introd.), for Erasmus expects the Count to have seen it: but it neither
answers nor is answered by Ep. 1078, in which the Count gives his opinions on
Lee and his notes. It would appear, therefore, that the two letters crossed, and
that this replies to one which is not extant. A fairly precise mouth-date may
be assigned from the place.

As a result of his new connexion (see Ep. 1053. 133n) Hillen seems to have
taken advantage of Erasmus‘ presence in Antwerp to request a letter of com-
mendation for a friend's book that he was about- to print. The repetition of
some sentences almost word for word from the praise of Vives in Ep. 917 implies
that Erasmus must have had that letter before him in composing this ; cf. also
Ep. 1066. 52-61.]

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS CLARISSIMO D. HERMANNO, COMITI
A NOVA AQVILA, CANONICO COLONIENSI, S. D.

vaM ni superi omnes te diligunt, ornatissime Comes, cuius
stemmatis, cuius opibus istum addiderint animum, vt nihil prius
habeas quam vti genus ac fortunam probitatis et litterarum veris
aeternisque ornamentis condecores, Sed iterum atque iterum foelix

5 es, cuius egregiis conatibus sic modis omnibus faueat φέρων ἄνεμός τε
καὶ ὕδωρ. O arcem Apollinis domicilium, 0 nemora Musis dicata! in
quibus ad Plinii nepotis exemplum assidue venaris, sed non absque
libellis; vt si parum fauerit Delia, tamen fauente Philologia non
sine lucro redeas domum. Prorsus inuiderem tibi istam plane deorum

10 vitam, ni charior esses quam vt quicquam bonae rei tibi possit
obtingere, quod non idem aeque meum esse ducam.

Porro quod vicissim scire cupis quid hic rerum agatur, feruet
etiamnuln ἡ πτωχοτυραννοφιλομουσομαχία. Sequlipedale verbum,
inquies: imo perbreue dices, si cum re conferas; nam isti nullum

¹5 omnino finem faciunt oblatrandi studiis optimis. Sed tu, inquis,
quid interim ’Β Ego vetus ille patronus praecoque pacis ac tranquilli-
tatis nunc πυκτεύω, ὖποπιάζων καὶ ὑποπιαζόμενος ἐν τῷ μέρει. Scio iam
exclamas, Ὢ τρισάθλιονῑ atqui magis istuc dicas si noris οἵῳ με τέρατι
συγκαθεῖρξεν ὁ δαίμων. Sed hoc ipse te docebit liber, quo nullus
²0 adhuc exiit multis retro saeculis nec indoctior nec virulentior.
