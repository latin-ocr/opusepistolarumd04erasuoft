Epistolae ad diuersos p. 568. Antwerp.
HN: Lond. xv. 13: LB. 502. 13 April 1520.

[Only 1520 and 1521 are possible ; for by April 1519 Carinus (Ep. 920 introd.)
had not yet come to Louvain with Nesen (cf. Epp. 994. 9n, 1034). But beyond
this Ι cannot confirm the year-date. No corroboration is obtainable from the
place ; for in 1521 Erasmus was again at Antwerp just at this time (Ep. 1199).

For Erasmus' three visits to Antwerp in March and April 1520 500 pp. 203, 216.
His intention was now, after supervising the printing of his third book against
Lee, the second Responsio which Hillen produced in May (p. 110), to go on into
Holland (Ep. 1092. 1). But the dates of his letters signed from Antwerp show
such short intervals that the visit to Holland ean hardly have been carried out
(of. Lond. xvii. 6, LB. 604, of October 1521). Between 3 and 5 May he returned
to Louvain (Epp. 1098,9).

Livinus Algoet <† 25 Jan. 1547) of Ghont (Index to H) entered Erasmus’
household as a servant-pupil 0. 1519, and remained with him for nearly seven
years 3 frequently carrying his letters. At Louvain he was a pupil of R. Rescius
(OE. p. 200), and became proficient in Latin and Greek z ‘ adeo . . . vt non
habuerimus apud nos illi similem ’, if he is the messenger of Zw. Ε.2 118 (cf. Ep.
1063 introd.). In Sept. 1524 Erasmus, who was not altogether satisfied with
him (O.¹p. 8), sent him to study medicine at Louvain (OE. p. 352), and pro-
posed that 110 5110111(1 work there with a young kinsman of Wolsey (Lond. xviii.
50, LB. 686) 3 at the same time, on the suggestion of Marcus Laui-inus (EE. 27 :
cf. ll. 25-7), trying to arrange that his Courtray pension (Ep. 436. 511) should pass
to Algoet at his death (Lond. xx. 46, xxi. 31; LB. 783, 822). But the young
man was disinclined to study, and in 1525 was still carrying letters (Em 30;
Horawitz v. 77, 803 LB. App. 330). 111 1527 110 was in Paris (EE. 71); but
Erasmus was disappointed in him (OE. p. 352), and did not, as Laui-inus
wished, make provision for him in his will. Continuing to hang about in quest
of court service, Algoet obtained temporary employment with Corn. Scepperus
at Augsburg (EE. 131); and at length attached himself to Nic. Olaus, who in
1531-2 procured him, with Erasmus' aid, a small post in the household of Queen
Mary of Hungary (OE. pp. 174—6‚ 196, 225). 011 6 Aug. 1532, being still a
dependant, Algoet married a granddaughter of Ant. Clava (OE. pp. 219, 224) : and
continuing with Olaus, was appointed in March 1534 to teach Queen Mary's
young pages (OE. pp. 477, 515). For the year 1532-3 he enjoyed the income of
Erasmus' Courtray pension (Basle MS. O. VI¹½ 71, f. 1). In Dec. 1538 he received
a present from the Queen for composing a genealogy of Charles v; by 1543 he
was king of arms for Flanders. In Erasmus' later years Algoet regained some
of his confidence, and often acted as messenger to him. See the detailed notes
in EE. E. Boehmer (Bibl. Wzffeniana, i, 1874, p. 93) mentions a rare volume,
narrating the proceedings of the Diet of Augsburg Pro religione Christiana, which
Algoet received an imperial privilege to print, 6 Nov. 1530.]

ERASMVS LIVINO ALGOTIO SVO S. D.

INCIDERVNT nonnulla praeter spem, quae reditum nostrum in dies
complusculos remorantur. Itaque quod iter ingressurus admonui,
visum est rursum inculcare literis. Vide ne committas vt absentia
nostra te segniorem ad studia reddidisse videatur, quae potius debuit
acuere. Nimirum quo plus tibi vacat temporis ab obsequiis quibus 5
praesenti soles inseruire, hoc par est attentius incumbere literis.
Hac certe spe te reliqui Louanii, magis tuo commodo consulens quam
