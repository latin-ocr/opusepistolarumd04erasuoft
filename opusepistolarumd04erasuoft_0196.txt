152 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [15 1 9

Itaque pene in animo est, absolutis Paraphrasibus in Paulum, quod
aspirante Christo facturus sum his hibernis mensibus, in posterum
mihi canere et Musis, imo Christo magis. Descendat alius qui volet

525 in harenam, ego cum huiusmodi monstris satis mihi videor luctatus.
Expedit nonnunquam deploratae maliciae cedere, cum nec officii
fructus est vllus et irritati mali grauius laedunt.

Sed nos querelae finem faciamus oportet, cum illi suae vesaniae
nullum faciunt finem. Illa querela iustissima mihi tecum communis

530 est, quod mors ademit Ioannem Coletum⁷ mihi syncerissimum amicum,
tibi singularem patronum, praeceptorem ac potius parentem. Ο verum
theologum! o mirum Euangelicae doctrinae praeconem 2 Quanto
studio vir ille imbiberat philosophiam Christi Σ quam auide hauserat
pectus ac spiritum diui Pauli! Vt coelesti doctrinae totius vitae

535 puritate respondit! Quot annos ille gratis populum docuit, et in hoc
suum Paulum referens! Nunquam mihi tam familiare aut non
serium cum illo colloquium fuit, quin ab eo discederem melior, aut
certe minus malus. Quo magis tibi, Lupsete, adnitendum vt tantum
praeceptorem, quicum tot annos domesticam consuetudinem egeris, et

540 eruditione referas et pietate. Bene vale.

I cannot identify the person addressed. He evidently was expected to know
something of Mainz and its antiquities‚ so that he had probably at some time
been resident there. The second part of the letter indicates that he was
head of a community which had control of a house near the Chapter school
at Antwerp: of which Nicholas of Hei-togenbosch (Ep. 616. 1411) was now
master.

It is possible that Erasmus was intending James Probst XPraepositus) of
Ypres ε for whom see Ep. 980. 54n. Mistakes in Christian names occur not infre-
quently in Erasmus' letters (cf. Epp. 966 tit. nn, 1006. 147, 1057 int1·od.‚ 1162. 152,
1200 tit.⁷ 1281. 5—7)‚ especially of persons with whom he was unfamiliar. Of
Probst's antecedents before 1518 nothing seems to be known ; but- at this time
he was head of the Augustinians at Antwerp. Their convent since 1514 had
been situated a little distance to the south of the cathedral. but within its
parish (J. C. Diercxsens, Antuerpia Christo nascens, iii, 1773, pp. 279‚80; cf. de
Decker in MSH, 1883, pp. 374‚5)‚ so that they might quite well have owned
a house which was near the Chapter school. Probst is known to have been
intimate subsequently with Nicholas of Hertogenbosch‚ being involved in the
same persecution by the Inquisition. If Erasmus had written his local desig-
nation ‘Ipan0⁷, it might conceivably have boen misread at Basle from his
rough draft as ‘Edano't for in contracting ρι’· he not infrequently curls the
