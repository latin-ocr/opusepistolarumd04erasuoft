APPENDIX XIV

EPPENDORFF‘S COPY OF THE EPISTOLAE AD
DI VERSOS.

IN the library of the late Dr. Seebohm, which is still preserved in
his home at Hitehin‚ is a copy of Erasmus' Epistolae acl diuersos (F),
Basle, Froben, 31 Aug. 1521, to which former owners have im-
parted considerable interest. On the inside of the cover, which is
clearly the original binding, is inscribed by a contemporary hand,
‘Danielo Stibaro, equiti Franco, Basileae xn Ol. Iulii xxvnr’3 on
the fly-leaf opposite are the words ‘ Sum Danieli Stibari equitis ’ς
and at the end, in contemporary manuscript, on the blank space of
p. 668 and the fly-leaf which follows, are two letters from Melanch-
thon to Erasmus, the second being Lond. Mel. iii. 66, iv. o 5, LB. 952,
of 23 March 1528, and the first a short note of the same date
which does not seem to be found in any other source, introducing
Melanchthon’s pupil, John Reyffensteyn‚ who had known Erasmus
and Goelenius formerly at Louvaiu (ME. 515, 1081).

Daniel Stibarus (1503—1555) of Rabeneck, between Bamberg and
Bayreuth, was a young Franconian knight who had been an ardent
fellow-student with Camerarius (Narratio cle Eobano, 1553, f0. C2) at
Erfurt c. 1520. He visited Basle in 1528 and stayed for some time
in Erasmus’ house (cf. Q. 39): also reading law with Boniface
Amerbach. Later in the year he went on to Paris, and returned by
way of Antwerp, Louvain and Frankfort to Franconia in the spring.
In the winter of 1529—30 he was again for some months with Eras-
mus at Freiburg: whence he returned to Wurzburg to the duties
of a canonry, which had been confer-red upon him in early life, and
to become councillor to the Bishop (p. 306). Four letters written to
him by Melanchthon between 1536 and 1554 survive ; in which he
is saluted as a patron, and pleasure is expressed at his retaining
‘memoriam nostrae veteris consuetudinis' (ME. 1471). The two
letters from Melanchthon to Erasmus copied into the Seebohm
volume must have arrived at Basle not long before Stibarus acquired
it. It is therefore not surprising that Stibarus should have had
them copied into his book t the handwriting is not his own.

But the volume had had a previous owner. In the inscription on
the front fiy-leaf only the name ‘ Danieli Stibari ⁹ is in his autograph,
written over an erasure. The outer words, ‘Sum ’ and ⁴ equitis ’,
are by an earlier hand, and between them was a name which has
been so thoroughly scratched out that even when the clue is supplied,
it is not easily decipherable. But at numerous points throughout the
book are marginal comments in manuscript by the same hand,
