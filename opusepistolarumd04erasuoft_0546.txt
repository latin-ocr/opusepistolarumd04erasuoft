498 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1521

1206. To BEATUS RHENANUS.

Gouda MS. 1324, f. 46 (a). Louvain.
F. sss‘. (1²2 HN: Lond. i. 1 : LB. 507. 27 May (1521).

[The preface to the Epz‘srolae acl diuersos (Fi, where it appears on the initial
sheet printed after the completion of the rest of the volume. The year-date has
only the authority of H, and needs correction3 see App. 12 in vol. iii, pp. 627,8
and Ep. 1011 introd.

There is a contemporary copy in one of the Gouda MSS. (see App. 9 in vol. i),
which differs not a little from the text of F, especially in the order of words.
The value of this source is not easy to determine. As has been shown (vol. i,
pp. 611,12) the copyist of the Gouda MSS. seems to have had access to original
documents, and in consequence his work may be regarded as having good
authority. On the other hand, some of it (eg. Ep. 325) appears to have been
copied from printed books ; and that this may be the case here is suggested by
the marginal inscription, by the same hand, against this letter, ‘Praefatio in
2ἰιιὶ aeditionem Farraginis epistolarum suarum ‘. In view, however, of the
variants shown in Ep. 1225, which follows this in both the 1115. and F, Ι incline
to think that the Gouda copyist may have had a manuscript before him: so
that his text may have precedence, though it is not necessary to retain his
spelling, which, in the frequent use of c for t, is not that of Erasmus.

1f Ep. 660 15 rightly placed iu 1519 (see p. 67⁸, the publication of F was
designed before the Farraqo (E) had appeared. E sold so well that within a few
months Froben wished to issue it again (Ep. 1066. 83-7). But Erasmus, perceiv-
ing that the editors had been incautious (ibid.; cf. Ep. 1244. 3611), would not
consent to a new issue until he had revised it. This process was begun in the
summer of 1520 (Ep. 1123. 6-8) 3 and was eompleted about the end of November
[Ep. 1163. 6-9 ; cf. Ep. 1170 introd.). The first part of the ‘copy’ for theEpistolare,
as F is sometimes called, together with that for the Paraphrases omnes (cf. Ep.
1171 introd.)‚ was sent to Basle shortly after Christmas ’1520 : see Froben's letter
to Boniface Amerbach 111 Basle MS. G. ΙΙ. 29. 115, which is discussed in vol. iii,
p. 628n. Though the title-page of F bears the date 31 Aug. 1521, the latest letter
in the book is one written on 22 Nov. ¹521, after Erasmus‘ arrival at Basle (Ep.
1243) ; but it is not the last, being followed by twenty-nine pages of text. In
consequence the printing was not completed on 24 Jan. 152² (OE. ii. 5). The
purchase of a copy in March 1522 is described in App. 143 and it is evidently
to the new edition that Luther refers in LE ². 525, of 15 May 1522, ‘Erasmus in
’ sua Epistolaruin Farragine '. There is another example of the title ‘Farrago ’

applied to a later edition than Ε 111 Ep. 1211 introd. ⁴

For Erasmus’ estimate of the editors' performance see Ep. 1244. 3611 ; and, for
the significance of his contribution of a preface, vol. i, pp. 594‚5.]
