58 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1519

1010. To THE READER.

Nouum Testamentum, 1519, tit. v0 (a). <Bruges ⁶.»
1 September 1519.

[A preface written for a separate issue of Erasmus’ Latin version of the New
Testament, as printed from his original translation (cf. Ep. 384 introd.) in the
edition of March 1519 : Nouum Testamentum omne iuxta Graecorum emendata volumina,
interpraete Erasmo Roteroctmno, Louvain⁷ Th. Martens‚ 1519, 16⁰ (Ghent Univ. Lib„
Res. 1137). In the Apol. qua respondet (f0. D³ νο ; ἔοι-ΞΜ ii. 512) he describes this
issue as undertaken against his wishes; and says t iat he added this preface
‘haudquaquam in rem typographi ⁷, in order to warn the reader not to accept
any text, not even that of Greek manuscripts, without critical examination. At
the same time he testifies, as here, that his desire 'was not to supersede the Vulgata,
but only by what he considered a more correct translation to throw light on the
meaning of the Greek text :¹ cf. Epp. 809. 84-93‚ 860. 44—9.

’ Τ110 separate issue proved a success, and was quickly mprinted, either complete
or the Gospels only, by Schuinann at Leipzig 18 Oct. 1519 and 1520, by Cratander
at Basle Aug. 1520 and March 1521, by Morhard at Strasburg Sept. 1520 and
1521, and by Anshelm at Hagenau 1520 {see BErl. pt. ii, pp. 26, 57). Unless
there is a prior Martens or Froben edition of 1520, Cratander's issue of Aug.
1520 15 notable as containinga new piece by Erasmus—the only case that Ι know
ot' where Cratander printed anything of his for the first time z a ‘ noua praefatio '
to the reader— Quod apud Matthccemn, without date-q which again disclaims any
intention of finding fault with the Vulgate‚ but otherwise 15 of little interest,
and therefore need not be included among Erasmus’ letters. A Froben edition
of 14 June 1521 reprints this of Cratander’s closely; but in a later edition—after
Erasmus' return to Basle—-by Froben, July 1522, which has the text as slightly
modified in the New Testament of Feb. 1522, two new prefaces are substituted
for that of 1521, also addressed to the reader and without dates, The first,
Toties iam dictum, repeats again his disclaimer ·hac versione non damnari mihi
vulgatam aeditionem qua nunc vtitur Ecclesia Romana, sed vt illa sit emendatior
magisque perspicua& The second, Quanquam z'n rebus diuinis, which 0011105 at
the end of the book, 15 of the nature of a Paraclesls rather than a letter, and was
doubtless composed ⁶ in rem typographi ’ (cf. Ep. 43 introd.) to fill the last eight
pageS. Neither is suitable for inclusion here. All the three later prefaces
appear in Froben editions of Jan. and 001. 1523, Nov. 1524, and s. α. ; but 50 far
as I can discover—there are Froben editions of 1521 48⁰* and 1532 which 1 have
not seen—, this preface was not reprinted in any author-ized volume.

After 1521 unauthorized rcprints of Erasmus’ Latin version of the New Testa-
ment become very numerous, especially in Ger-many and Switzerland. Trans-
lations of it appeared, too, into German 1523, Fleinish 1525, Bohemian 1533,
English 1538, Italian 1545, Polisli 1552, French 1554; see BEr1. pt. ii, N. Test.

Erasmus' movements at this tinie are not clear (Ep. 1013. 2311) ; but there is
reason to suppose that about 1 Sept. he was at Bruges (Epp. 1012, 1025. 411),
staying, no doubt, with his friend Marcus Laurinus, the Dean of St. Donatianis]

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS AEQVIS LECTORIBVS S. D.

ME plane reclamante factum est, optime lector, vt Nouum Testa-
mentum a me versum absque Annotationibus excuderetur typis, hoc
est nudum et inerme Zoilorum dentibus obiiceretur. Sed quando
vicit aliorum vel consilium vel quaestus, quod proximum est et vnum

5 restat, admonitum te volo, ne, quicquid senseris a vulgata receptaque
translatione dissonare, protinus sic interpreteris quasi mea noua
veterem suggillet ac reprehendat.· Nos quod in emendatis Graecorum
codicibus repperimus, 510 vertimus vt aliquoties nostra Graecis prae-
feramus, nonnunquam ita conserimus vt lectori iudicium relinqua-

10 mus vti-a sit potior lectio. Certe docuimus, et negari non potest, in
nostris codicibus inulta esse loca deprauata, nonnulla vel obscure vel
ambigue vel barbare reddita, quaedam hactenus parum intellecta.
