THE HEINE COLLECTION 621

numbered VIII—XXIV, a list is given at the end of this Appendix.
They consist of seven written by or to Erasmus. of which two are
printed in vol. v (Epp. 1277, 1312), and five follow later, 1525—31 :
four are between John Vel-gara and Stunica, and are printed below:
and there are six others, one of which (No. xx) is by Benedictus
Arias Montanus.

As to the provenience of this series of seventeen‚ by the earlier
hand, there are no clear indications. Two of them¹ were doubtless
copied from the 1115. which Heine had at Madrid; since their
originals are there. But the only other 01119 to origin is in a note
by the copyist, on a separate sheet: ‘Copiada del tomo 412, folio
588 y 589. Esta escrita en el original en tres llanas. Segun la
calidad de 135 varias emiendas, es original de Arias Montano la
letra de que esta escrita. Es de aduertir que, sino vna 0 (105
119095, 11111103 mas pone tilde a la i, quando yere, como en admno.
El primer blanco esta assi en el original ⁹. This clearly refers
to some writing by Arias Montanus which is not now in the
set; but which was in his autograph. There cannot be many
collections of 11155. large enough to contain 400 volumes of a series,
each possibly with about 600 folios. If the source of this autograph
composition could be traced, it might lead to the recovery of the
originals of the letters. For another 1115. 111 the Bibl. Nacional at
Madrid, which is perhaps by the same hand. see p. 631.

How this second section passed into Heine’s hands there is nothing
to show. It is not uncommon to find later copies existing, side by
side with original letters (cf. Ep. 1218 introd.)--made perhaps for
the purpose of sending to the press. Thus the Neve collection
(App. 16 in vol. v), when bought for the British Museum and
Bodleian, possessed besides the originals, a series of inaccurate
copies made for Mgr. de Ram, who had intended to publish them:
again, Dr. Dollinger had had the last nine of Heine’s second section
copied, doubtless for the purpose of printing. It may well be that
the owners of the originals of Heine’s second section at some period
entertained a similar design 3 and that later some reasonably generous
librarian or archivist presented the copies to Heine on the occasion of
his Spanish visit, with a view to their being published when Heine
returned to Germany.

Vergara's correspondent, Jacobus Lopis Stunica (Diego Lopez
Zuffiga), was a member of a distinguished Spanish family (5²ef. Ep.
487. 14n); and as a theologian of the University of Alcala had a
competent knowledge of Greek and Hebrew. On the appearance of
Erasmus* Nouum Instmmentum, 1516, he prepared some criticisms
which he wished to publish. Ximenes forbade him (Ep. 1128. 4n) ;
but on the Cardinal's death Stunica produced his two series of
Annotatz'ones against Faber Stapulensis and Erasmus (Ep. 1128. 3n).
From ff. ΑΒ· and A² of these two publications it is evident that he
was one of the editors of the Complutensian Polyglott, though his
name does not appear in it: for his part in the work see F. Delitzsch‚
Studies on the Complut. Polystot, 1872, pp. 24-32. About the end of
