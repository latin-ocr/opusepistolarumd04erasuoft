1189. 4. Βιβλία] Of. Ep. 1174. 14-17.

5. Antwerpiae] Erasmus had been
there recently ; for Diirer notes in his
Tayebuch (ed. F. Leitschuh‚ 1884, p. 75)
between 12 Feb. and 10 March ι ‘Ich
hab . . . ein mahl mit maister Peter
secretary (gessen), do Erassmuss Ro-
deradamus auch mit ass’. 'rhe visit
was perhaps made between 1—13 March
(Epp. 1187, 1192).

6. Paschate] 31 March 1521.

8. Minoritis] Cf. Ep. 1174. 15n.

9. Augustini] See Ep. 844. 255n.

1190. 5. Arnoldo] John Aerts 01·
Arnoldi w 27 Sept. 1537) of Nosaeghem,
between Brussels and Louvain, was
Prior of val St. Martin c. 1493 to 1497,
when he resigned because of ill-health
and went as Rector to a convent ofnuns‚
Bethany n earLeeuwSt.Pie1·re‚ 1«. of Hal.
About 1509 he was again elected Prior,
and remained in office till he died. He
added some fine buildings to the monas-
tery3 but his detractors nicknamed

him ‘Prior platteborsse' See A.

Sanderus, &comm-aphia sacra meantiae,
1727, ii. 124 ; and Horawitz v. 49, 53,
56‚72,80‚93-

Some verses given by Saudorus, sta-
ting that he was a monk for ten Olym-
piads and lived for four lustres besides,
seem to indicate that he was only 60
when he died. If so, it must be in-
feri-ecl that instead of two tenures of
office by the same person, there were
two Priors of the same name. But
possibly an Olympiad is to be taken
there as five years; as it is by Thos.
Radinus (Ep. 1 167.408n), whose Sicleralis
abyssus is said to have been printed in
the first. year after the 302nd Olympiad
from the Nativity (1511). On such a
calculation Jo. Arnoldi would have been
70 at death.

collected edition of March 1521 (p. 123);
for the completion of which cf. Ep.
Ῑ177· 44-7·

received, in Epp. 1197‚8.
