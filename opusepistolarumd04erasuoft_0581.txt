[The date is sufficiently confirmed by Erasmus? residence at Anderlecht, and
by his forthcoming visit to Bruges.

Livinus Hugenoys (†1535), monk of St. Bavo’s at Grhent, was elected Abbot,
4 Nov. 1517 τ probably at an advanced age, since for some years before his death
he had his successor as coadjutor. He was the last Abbot on the old footing:
for in the year following his death the Abbey church was made collegiate and
the monks were converted into seculars (GC. v. 183). Besides other generosity
(Ep. 1271. 124-6) he lent Erasmus a Latin MS. of the Gospels for one of the later
editions of the N. Τ., perhaps the second (cf. Epp. 373 inti-od, 597. 1611) 2 but
the unflattering description of his library in the colloquy Sgsuoclzts ymmmatz'commz
(LB. i. 825 AB: first published in 1529) indicates thar. it was mainly medieval.
He is there called ‘homo senex' (cf. Ep. 1025. 1611). In Erasmus' will of 1527
he is one of the 20 recipients named for presentation copies of the p1·0jected

edition of Erasmus? collected works.]

QVAE praeter meritum obtingunt, hoc plus solent habere precii3
-et quae praeter expectationem obueniunt, solent esse gratiora. Non-
nunquam et autor magnificus precium addit suo muneri. Nihil
autern tam per se vile est quod non eximie charum reddatur si
proueniat ab animo amico. Quot igitur nominibus mihi putas5
gratum fuisse munus tuum, Praesul egregie, quod per insignem
virum Cornelium, aduocatum a fisco, misisti? adeo non expectanti
vt si de coelo delapsum fuisset, non potuisset magis inexpectatum
accidere. Nam quod vltro mittitur, quod immerenti, quod nec per
somnium expectanti, non potest non ab amicissimo pectore proficisci. 10
Et munus per se gratissimum verbis etiam commendas. Negas esse

salutandi gratia. Amplector igitur istum animum tuum, et agnosco
quid debeam. Vt pariter te reclamem, tamen hoc calculo vinces,
