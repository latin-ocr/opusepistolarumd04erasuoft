Copenhagen MS. G. K. S. 95 F01.‚ f. 246. <L0uvain.)

[An autograph rough-draft in the Copenhagen MS. ; for which see App. 13 in
vol. iii. The dates can be assigned from Ep. 1127, which also was carried by
Draco (Ep. 871).

Conrad of Thuengen, 10 ms, N. of Wurzburg (ψ 16 June 1540) came of an
ancient Franconian family. As a young man he studied in Italy, making the
acquaintance of Pirckheimer at Padua or Pavia, c. 1490—7 3 and there doubtless
imbibed that interest in learning which led men of letters to hail him as a
patron in the days of his power. He returned to a canonry at Wurzburg, and
for some time had been marked out as a suitable coadjutor to his predecessor in
the see, Laurence of Bibra († 1519); on whose death he was within nine days
elected to succeed. As Bishop he was also Duke of Eastern Franconia. In
politics he was a strong supporter of the Em peror, and he took an important part
in the Diets of 1520-303 opposing the new movements. But within his own
diocese he worked hard for conservative reform‚and dealt severely with miscon-
duct among his clergy. When his castle of Marienburg, opposite Wurzburg. was
besieged by the Peasants, May—June 1525, he did not play a heroic part ; leaving
the defence to his Hofmeister‚ Sebastiam Rotenhaen (Ep. 1134), and retiring to
Heidelberg, but returning to participate in the exactiori of bitter vengeance.
See ADB. xvi. 632—43 and, for his political activities 1521-3, Planitz's Berichte,
cd. E. Wiilcker and H. Virck, 1899.

From his first accession to the bishopric he began to receive dedications τ of
Hutten's dialogue, Fortuna, 1 Jan. 1520 (HE. 149); of Plutarch's De (immutate,
translated by Pirckheimer, Nuremberg, F. Peyp, 1523 (P. p. 243); of the fifth
edition of Eck's Enchiridion locorum communium aduersus Ludderanos‚ Ingolstadt,
12 May 1529; of Guimundus’ De Eucharistia, edited by Aug. Marius, Freiburg,
J. Emmeus, 1530? ofErasmus' commentary on Psalm 33, Basle, Froben, March
15313 of Alex. Trallianus’ De corporis vitiis, translated by Alban Torinus, Basle,
H. Petri, March 1533.

The present beginning of correspondence with Erasmus does not seem to have
been followed up ; but friendly letters passed between them in 1529-31‚ and in
1534 the Bishop was one of Erasmus' strong admirer-s (ΕΕ.2 116).]

CONRADO, PRAESVLI WERTZENBVRGENSI.

S. P„ ornatissime Praesul. Cum sim et natura verecundior quam
vt plebeiis etiam hominibus vltro soleam litteris meis negocium
facessere, et nunc occupatior quam vt vacet cuiquam omnino scribere,
tamen huius Draconis improbitas extudit hanc a me epistolam ad

5 amplitudinem tuam ; quam accipio cum semper optimis ac sanctissi-
mis studiis delectatam, tum in presentia singulari fauore prosequi
litterarum honestarum cultores. Inter quos vtinam me iure queam
connumerare! Certe videor inter hos posse referri qui sua quali-
cunque industria aliis addunt animos, quemadmodum faciunt qui in

10 acie classicum canunt, ipsi tamen interim a praelio semoti ; quiue in
certaminibus suffundunt frigidam, cum ipsi cursu non certent.
