1169. To AUGUSTINE SCARPINELLUS.

[1520 is the only year in which Erasmus returned to Louvain from Aachen at
this season.

Augustine Scarpinellus of Naples was in attendance upon Marlianus at the
Court ; and in that position had perhaps made Erasmus’ acquaintance as early
as 1516—17. After the eoronation he went on with Marlianus to Worms
(cf. Epp. 1195, 1198); where during the Diet he fell ill. He was perhaps
already a person of importance ; for in 1522 he was sent as Milanese ambassador
‘to England. He remained there till 1532, enjoying the credit of ‘a man of
great ability’ (Bi-own iv. 69). Numerous dispatches from and to him are to be
found in Brewer iii, iv; Bergenroth iii, iv; Brown iv; and Hinds.

He has been identified, quite probably, by P. Kalkoff (Repert. s. Kunstwissen-
schast xxvii, 1904, p. 34811) with the ‘meister Augustin Lumbarth ' to whom
Diirer (chyebuch, ed. F. Leitschuh, 1884, p. 54) presented two woodcuts at
Antwerp in Aug. 1520: in view of Scarpinellus’ connexion with Marlianus and
Milan, Diirer may easily have made a mistake as to his nationality.

I cannot discover that his interest in Cicero led him to undertake any edition.
Erasmus wrote to him again with intimacy on 30 Aug. 1524 (Ep. 1478). In
1535 he wrote to Erasmus from Ferrara (LE. 1277).]
