68 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 5 1 9

Erasmus' relations with Froben and his other friends at Basle. The Panegyyrici
veteres were printed by Froben in Dee. 1520, with a preface by Beatus (BRE. 187)
to Lucas Bathodius (Ep. 883. 1311). In addition to the collection of Panegyrics
published at Milan (ss- 1481 : Proetor 58371, Bruno's copy of which (ll. 2-3) was
110 doubt used by the printers, they contain, as Erasmus directed (ll. 1—2), his
own (Epp. 179, 180> and Ausonius’; also others by Hermolaus Barbarus to
Frederick 111 and Maximilian, delivered at Bruges, 1 Aug. 1486 ; by Pandulphus
Collenutius to Maximilimi, at Innsbruck, <1494); and by Geo. Sam-omanus to
Charles and Ferdinand, ο. 1 Feb. 1519, on Maximilian's death.

The autograph original of the letter from which this is taken is at Basle ; there ⁸

is also a copy at Schlettstadt, which I have not seenv except as printed in BRE.
From the variant in l. 4 it appears to have been made from Beatus’ rough draft.
He writes ε

Iubet Erasmus in suis acl me literis vt Frobenius Pane-(lyricos veteres excudat, ipsius
addendo Paneyyricum ei* Ausom'anum cccl Gratianum Gaesarem. Dabis mitur codicem
tuum, quem ‘in marqinibus contaminaui, Frobem'o, priusquam cllscedas. Et de hac re
Frobenizcm monebis ; nam ozon veniebat i η mentem vt id ei elicerem, cum hic medius quartus

5 adesset.

About a month later, after Bruno's death, Beatus wrote again to Nepos, con-

veying Erasmus' message in very similar words (BRE. 191).]

100410151066 FROM WILLIAM BUDAECS.

Epistolae Bmlaei, 1520, f. 124 v0. (ει). Marly.
F. p. 213: HN: Lond. iii. 69: LB. 458. 15 September (1519).
Budaei Epistol-ae, 1531, f. 61 VO. (b).

[This letter, like Epp. 1011, 1073, was printed byBudaeus 111 ΒΕ.1 (ἃ) before it
appeared in any of Erasmus’ editions. The connexion of F with a, and specially
with a2, is shown eonclusively by the readings in ll. 111, 112, 142 and 94, 96,
100, 106. For BE.³ (b) see Ep. 403 introd. Not being wholly in Greek, this letter
is placed there in the Latin section, and therefore is not found in the later
issues of Budaeus’ Greek letters mentioned in Ep. 1011 introd-

It was carried by one of the Gourmonts, probably the printer (see Ep. 263. 9n),
who chaneed to visit Marly; see ΒΕ.4 51.]
