296 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1520

latter suggestion should for this reason be the more probable. But, though the
dates added in H have usually little or no value, such an adventure as just
missing a friend might have remained with some distinctness in Erasmus'
memory : so that he could place it correctly, when considering it again after a
lapse of years. In favour of Antwerp‚ too, is the consideration that he would
hardly have been sending a letter of More for Pace to see, if More and Pace had
recently been together: as they were at Calais. It is noticeable that on his
way to Antwerp Erasmus fell in with an English horseman (Ep. 1117. 1,2), who
may have been one of Pace’s retinue.

Erasmus’ visit to Calais was the result of invitations from More (Epp. 1087,
1096, 1106) and Warham (Epp. 1101,2; cf. BRE. 166) ; who evidently designed
that he should take part in the ceremonial meetings of the three sovereigns (cf.
Ep. 1106. 92n). He was ready to accept, and finally went ; but at first
was detained by ill—health (p. 283), and in the latter part of June was at
Antwerp (Ep. 1117). His time at Calais is therefore probably to be placed
between 6-30 J uly, when his letters give no guidance as to his movements.
During that period he was at Bruges, evidently accompanying Charles (Ep.
1129. 111) ε so that it seems a reasonable conjecture that he went to Calais also
in the train of the Emperor, who was there 11—14 July.

He had a public interview with Henry (Ep. 1342. 844), and with Wolsey
probably at the same time (Ep. 1132. 1-3) ; but with the latter he had 110 satis-
factory intercourse, and possibly not with Henry either. In any case Andre
Meyer, Relations d'Erasme et de Luther, 1909, pp. 44—6, is clearly right in regarding
the conversation between Henry and Erasmus reported by Ο. Myconius, 20 Nov.
1520 (Hess ii. 607‚8), as in the main fabulous. With Longlond‚ the bishop of
Lincoln, however, he had more talk, and was invited to under-take a commentary
on the Psalms, one fruit of which was the In Psalmum quartum concio, Basle,
Froben, Feb. 1525 ι see Epp. 1535, 1570. More, too, he saw, of course (Ep. 1184.
21-2 )‚ and was shown a copy of the Epistola ad Brixiam (Ep. 1096. 121n). Also
he chanced to meet Lee (cf. Ep. 1132. 18n), and shook hands with him as a sign
of the reconciliation that had recently been effected (p. 111).]

 

ERASMVS ROTEROD. RICARDO PACAEO S. D.

Simo mihi redditum est tuum epistolium, iam te conscendente
equos. Cupiebam tecum colloqui, et fortassis adhuc dabitur. Ex
animo gratulor tibi noua dignitate aucto ; cuius meritis nunquam par
fortuna responderit.

5 Sinon dabitur colloqui, commendo tibi negocium non tam meum
quam literarum. Quod enim molitur Leus ὁ κατάρατος, 11011 ad me
proprie pertinet, fortassis ad vestram Britanniam pertinet3 cuius
nonnihil refert, opinor‚vt laudum suarum praeconem habeat honestum.
Scio perpusillum esse laudis quod illi ex meis lucubrationibus accessit ;

10 tamen hoc ipsum illi Leus inuidere videtur.
