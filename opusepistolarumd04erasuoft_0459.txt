1168. To CHR1STOPHER HEGENDORFER.

Epistolae ad diuersos p. 540. Louvain.
HN: Lond. xiv. 12: LB. 548. 13 December 1520.

[Between Melanchthon's marriage (1. 811) and the publication of F.

Christopher Hegendorfer (c. 1500—8 Aug. 1540), was the son of a silkworker
who had migrated from the neighbourhood of Bamberg and settled at Leipzig.
Christopher matriculated at the University in 1513, was B.A. 1515, MA. 1520,
Rector 1523, and LL.D. 1526 3 and 110 lectured there on Priscian, Terence, Vergil,
Quintilian between the years 1521-5. He attended the Leipzig Disputation 111
1519, and afterwards spent a few months at Wittenberg (cf. Ep. 1 102. 1011), where
he became attracted towards Luther. But apart from this he remained fixed at
Leipzig till 1530. Ηο 111011 migrated to Posen (cf. ME. 1139, 1148> at the invita-
tion 01 the Bishop, as head of the town-school ; but left 111 1535, being attacked
by the Archdeacon for his Lutheran sympathies (cf. A. Jochera, Obra: . . .
w Polsce, ii, 1842, pp. 237-8‚ 514—15, nos. 3¹38-40)· During these years he seems
to have wandered as far eastwards as Brest-Litovsk ; perhaps 0. 1531-2
(cf. La. E. 21). After a short period as Professor of Law at Frankfort-on-the-
Oder, in 1537 he went as Syndic to Luneburg. About Michaelmas 1539 he was
invited for a time to Rostock‚ to help in the reorganization of the Universsty,
which had suffered in the struggles of the Reformati0n3 but he returned to
Luneburg as Superintendont of the church (cf. ME. iv. 1063), 111 tenure of which
office he died.

His literary activity was eeaseless. Beginning in 1518 with some slight
volumes of verse, he produced a rapid succession of small educational books,
notes 011 classical authors, theological and moral works⁷ and legal commentaries3
the last of which gained him most fame (cf. VE. 1190). See an admirably careful
sketch of him by O. Giinther in Plautuserneuerunqen, 1886, pp. 70-91 3 an excellent
bibliography by F. Cohrs in Evanq. Katechismusversuclze (Mon. German. Paedctqoq.
xxii), 1901, 347—414; and EE. Two autograph letters from him to Capito, whom
110 stylcs ‘praecept0r’‚ are in the Basle Ms. Ki. Ar. 25. a. 76-8.

His relations with Erasmus were few. This is the only known letter which
passed between them; and Erasmus rarely, if ever, mentions his name else-
where. The letter which this answers, perhaps had its origin in Hegendorfer’s
desire to explain the appearance of two of his Dialoyi appendcd to an edition,
Strasburg, J. Knoblouch, 8 Aug. 1520, of Erasmus’ Fam. Colloqztiorzcm Fomnulae,
according 1ο 1110 last recension (cf. Ep. 1041). In a later edition by Knoblouch,
April 1521, tho Dialoqi are mentioned on thc title-page, but do not appear in the
text: see BEr2. Colloq. 1, pp. 83, 93.]
