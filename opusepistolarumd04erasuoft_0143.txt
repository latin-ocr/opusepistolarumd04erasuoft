detachment from them (ll. 34-42‚ 192-211). But this purpose was only seeondary.
His main concern was to continue in a new quarter (cf. Epp. 1007, 1060, 1062)
his protest against the attitude towards learning adopted by the regular orders.
The Archbishop (Ep. 661 inti-od.) was credited with wide sympathies‚ and his
friendliness towards Erasmus gave good hopes of secui-ing his support against a
campaign of deti-action which was likely to have serious results. Apart from
a single name (1. 80) there was nothing in the letter that Erasmus need wish to
conceal, except perhaps the allusions (ll. 130, 223) to the traffic in indulgences,
from which the Archbishop was already deriving large profits 3 and, but for being
too late, it would probably have been included, like Ep. 967, in E. It was, in fact,
one of the first selected for the new portion of F—only Epp. 299 and 645 precede
it—and there is very little change in the text ; less than might have been
expected under the circumstances. The agreement of F with β in many readings,
as against -γδ, may be remarked ; but though it seems probable that all the un-
authorized editions are prior in time to F, it is hardly likely that the Basle
editors would have used any one of them to print from.

The text of the Cologne editions is on the whole the best, especially as con-
taining what seems a more accurate mouth-date3 but, as Erasmus indicates, it
is not uniformly satisfactory. I have adopted it as the basis, but have discarded
some of its readings. In the sigla αμδ precede F. The year—date is amply con·
firmed by the contents. Egli notes several passages in the Epistola de maqistris
nostris Louaniensibus [Zw. E.2 pp. 385—8), which evidently imitate this letter.]
