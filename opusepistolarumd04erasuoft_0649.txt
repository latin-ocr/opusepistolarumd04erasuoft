The reasons which determined Erasmus to leave Louvain and go to Basle
were various. He was weary of the incessant controversies in which 116 had
been involved (Lond. xix. 33, LB. 1033) ς and he wished to see the notes of his
third edition of the New 'l'estament (Ep. 1174. 15n) through the press (Epp.
1302. 8—13, 1342. 90-6). But the most powerful motive was the tear that Court
pressure, exercised through Glapion (Ep. 1275), might compel him to enter the
lists definitely against Luther (ΟΕ. pp. 351-2, and a Responsio of 1530, LB. x.
1612c; cf. Ep. 1342. 47). When he started, his intention was to return in the
spring (cf. Ep. 1209. 4n); and he probably did not propose to stay longer in
Basle than on his previous visits. But having reached the circle of his friends,
he found it hard to tear himself away. Writing in 1533, he could say that he
had never regretted the migration (OE. p. 352).

His reception by the advanced party 111 Basle may 116 illustrated from a letter
of Conrad Pellican to Melanchthon‚ 30 Nov. 1521 (Κ. Hartselder, Melancltthoniana
paeclaqoqica, 1892, p. 19) t ‘Erasmus nobiscum est. Prudenter scribit 61 loquitur,
ne veritati non assit et periculum non scribendi euadat. Expedit vt sapienter
dissimulando inuidiam superet et promouentis vos in sacris studiis 11011
impediri sinat. Frangere mihi passim videtur iras atrocium, lenimentisque
oportunis insinuare inimicis modestiam. Egit sapienter id et caute nuper cum
Aleandro. Disputat crebro contra Lutheranos Papistarum inuentis, et nunquam
non pro veritate colligit et decertat. Scribit propediem in Euangelia, fortasse
Paraphrases. Epistolas suas nouissimas libro inclusit, pro Luthero omnes,
cautus atque solicitus ad omnes semper. Non possum non commendare virum ;
sed spiritum Lutheri non aequat ’. Melanchthon at 01106 conveyed the welcome
intelligence to Spalatinus (ME. 127) : ⁴ Erasmus Basileae est. Heri literas aesopi
a Pelecano longe iucundissimas, e quibus apparet nihil vanius esse eo rumore
quern sparserunt stulti quidam dc Erasmi aduersum Martinum voluntate ⁷.

Stanislaus Turzo (1-17 April 1540) was a younger brother of John, bp. ot'
Breslau (Ep. 850) ; and like his father and other members of his family, played
a conspicuous part in the affairs of Hungary. He matriculated at Cracow in
1485, and then spent some time 111 Rome. On his return he was appointed to
Olmutz, the chief see of Moravia, 111 1497 ; and in this capacity helped to crown
Louis 11 as King of Bohemia, 11 March 1509. In his palace at Kreinsier he
entertained Louis niagnificently in 1510, and Sigismund of Poland in 1516.

Like his brother he was a munificent patron of learning. Hutten wandering
through Moravia in 1511 received from him a horse and Journey-money (HE.
10 = VE. s3. 119). Τ116 provost of Olmutz, Aug. Moravus, received encourage-
ment in his studies (cf. Boh. E. ii b. 24), and dedicated to him a Cataloqus episcop.
clement-ensium, Vienna, H. Phssoualle, 8 March <1511 ?>.Ja1111s Dubiavius, the
historian, who was for long his counsessor, and followed him in the see, extols
the Christian simplicity of his life (Hist. Bohem. bk. 32) ; and dedicated to him
an edition of Martianus Capella, Vienna, H. Victor, 11 May 1516. Erasmus
was first brought to his notice in 1518 by Ja. Piso (Ep. 216), when the two
brothers were at Craeow (Ep. 1662) ; but though John at once opened correspon-
dence (Ep. 850), Stanislaus made no attempt to court the scholar's acquaintance
until July 1521, when he sent by Ursinus Velius the letter (not extant) which this
answers and a present (VE. 271). Ursinus' visit to Basle suggested to Beatus
Rhenanus that 116 should dedicate to 1116 Bp. his editio princeps ofTertullian, Basle,
Froben, July 1521 (BRE. 207) ; 111 return the Bp. sent him a cup in 1522, am]
at the same time a present of coins for Erasmus (Ep. 1272). Beatus then dedi-
cated to him a collection os Antores historiae ecclesiasticae, Basle, Froben, 1523
(BRE. 234): a compliment which the Bp. merited, since he could assui-e Beatus
