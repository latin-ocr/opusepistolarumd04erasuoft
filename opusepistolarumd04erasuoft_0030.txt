P. 38, Ep. 316 introd. Lucas Paliurus was perhaps son of Michael Klett
’ of Giitingen in Swabia, who was Pellican's schoolmaster at Ruffach
c. 1487 (CPR. p. 7). Lucas* name is mentioned in ZE. 78, of 28 Dec.
1525, at which date he appears to have been still in Basle3 and his
praise is in Oporinus' pref-ace to Saxo Grammaticus, Basle, Jo. Bebel,

1 .

§ather books dedicated to him are the Opera of Constantinus Africanus,
Basle, H. Petrus, Aug. 15363 and those of H. Vida, Basle, B. Lasius
and T. Platter, March 1537. The anniversary of the death of his widow‚
Dame Barbe, was celebrated on 29 Jan. ι see the Liber Vitae of the con-
fraternity of St. Michael at Portentruy‚ in L. Vautrey’s Jura Bemoz's ii,

(April) 1521, are some verses by Jo. Duncellus Hammelburgensis z
evidently the person mentioned here, since the place-designation connects
him with Froben. Erasmus had perhaps taken him to England with
the idea of sending him to Cambridge for his education (cf. Ep. 457. 55-9) ;
but 1 cannot find any trace of him in the University Grace-Books. For
a somewhat similar name to the form in Ep. 330. 21, see Ep. 1039 introd.‚
of a printer at Nuremberg in 1531.

P. 132, Ep. 347. 196. Prof. C. H. Turner points out to 1116 that the reading must

Gospels.

for he took the degree of M.D. at Siena on 12—13 Oct. 1511. ⁴

tion of the pages of Pt. ii of the Nouum lustramentum. 1516, is faulty; and
that instead of ‘more than 1,000 pages ' the correct number is 990.
