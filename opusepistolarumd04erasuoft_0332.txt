286 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [15 20

benignitatis auspiciis complures optimae spei iuuenes, qui olim et
maiora praestabunt et felicius, si studium illorum inflammarit aura tui
fauoris. Atque vtinam huc incumbant posthac nostra studia, vt ad
optimas disciplinas animi mortalium et breuitatis et facilitatis
illecebra pelliciantur potius quam, dum nos affectata difficultate pro-
lixitateque studemus videri magnifice docti, optima quaeque ingenia
a rebus optimis alienentur! Id praestabunt felicius alii permulti,
non dubito; at maiore fide quan] nos fecimus, non adeo multi.
Quod si huiusmodi sanctissimis conatibus, ita vt instituit, fauere
perget amplitudo tua, tum apud Deum egregiam laudem sibi parabit,
tum apud posteros honestissimam sui memoriam relinquet. Eam
nobis diutissime seruet incolumem Christus Optimus Maximus.

1113. To anp MELANCHTHON.

Gotha MS. chart. B. 20, f. 25 v0. Louvain.
ME. 80. (a. 21 June 1520.)

[From a manuscript in the Ducal Library at Gotha. The volume is written
by two or three early sixteenth-century hands, and contains a number of letters
and documents, most of which are concerned with Luther, while some have to
do with Breslau. The owner was perhaps John Hess, canon of Breslau, a fre-
quent correspondent of Luther and Melanchthon (cf. Ep. 1033 int1·od.). In any
case the orthography is not that of Erasmus. Forstemann's introductory note to
this letter in ME. 80 states that Sti-ohel printed it in Henke's Mayazz'n ,fi-{r
Reziyionsphilosophie, ii. 2, p. 204. That publication 1 have notbeen able to see:
but the similarity of some of its readings, as recorded by Forstemann‚ to those of
the Gotha MS. —differing widely from the inaccurate 'copy of the MS. used by
Bretschneider for ME.—suggests that Strobel also had the same ms. for his
orifllileadate is marked out with some precision by Hutten’s visit to Ferdinand
(ll. 36-7). This letter must precede Ep. 1115, in which Hutten has left; and as
it is written from Louvain, it must in any case be before 25 June (Ep. 1117).
Further evidence is that on 5 May both Luther and Melanchthon had written
recently to Erasmus (LE.·³ 302) ι Melanchthon’s being no doubt the letter
answered here. Later 011, at a date which cannot be defined, Melanchthon
forwarded to Spalatinus (ME. 87) letters which he had received from Erasmus
and Hutten—probably this and HE. 171* of 4 June (Hutcem' Opera, iv, p. 689; cf.
ZKG. xviii, 1898, pp. 403-4.) On 6Ju1y Erasmus describes this letter as written
nuper, and as intended for Luther quite as much as for Melanclithon (Ep. 1119.
26-7).

For communication between Melanchthon and Erasmus c. Aug. 1519 see ME.
