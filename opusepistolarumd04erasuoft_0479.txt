Imo iampridem oro vt

ingens aliquod sacerdotium coniiciat in caput meum. Non dubito
quin ille sit huic corpusculo superstes futurus; sed tamen in rebus 5

humanis certi nihil est.

Verum ne nihil impudenter faciam, in

praesentia cuperem mihi rursus numerari anni venturi pensionem.
aut certe syngrapham mitti per quam hic aut apud Italos recipiam.
Adorno enim profectionem in proximam quadragesimam, sed aestiua-
turus Basileae ; fortassis illinc repetiturus Italiam, nisi quid extiterit 10
in hoc principum conuentu quod me remoretur.

Paulus non nisi semel lapidatus fuit.

Hic ego quotidie lapidor

Praedicatorum et Carmelitarum conuiciis, idque et nominatim et in

publicis concionibus.

Sed nihil aliud efficiunt nisi vt populus etiam
intelligat illos agitari malis furiis.

teaching 111 the monastic school at Belbuk, b> Tieptow on the Rem, near the
coast of Pomerania: in close intercourse With Bugenhagen, who had been rcct01
of the town school since 1504. Both were aheady inclined to sympathy with

Knopken with some of his pupils withdrew to Reval and Dorpat z

finally settling at Riga, where on 23 Oct. 1522 he was appointed Archdeacon of
St. Peter’s church. He continued an ardent Lutheran, while appreciating also
the scholarship of Erasmus. In 1524 Bugenhagen printed for him at Witten-
berg, with the sanction of Melanchthon, some lecturos on St. Paul's Epistle to

to fall in with the suggestion. Erasmus-⁷
