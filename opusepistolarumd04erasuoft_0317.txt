18. Fortem] John Fuertes. orFurteS,
of Aragon was a student in Paris under
John Dolz of Aragon in 1511; see
Dolz's syllogismi, Paris, H. 10 feure, 15
Dec. 1511, 1⁸⁰. 1116, and Dz'scepiatioms,
ibid„ 16 Feb. 1513, f0. U⁹ νῦ. Ηο was
contubernalis with Vives; who introduces
him as one of the speakers in his Christi
Iesu Triumphus, Paris, J. Lambert, June
<1514 ⁴3), and dedicated to him an
edition of Hyginus, ibid„ S.a., with a
preface dated 31 March 1514 (ἰ) 151ξ),
and the Psmdodialectici (1. 7n).

28. Poblationem] «Ϊο. Martinus Po-
blacion wrote De vsu astrolabi compen-
dium, Paris, H. Stephanus, s. a. In the
notes on Aug. Ciu. Dei, Basle‚ Froben,
Sept. 1522 (xxii. 22 3 p. 774) Vives
praises his skill in medicine as well as
mathematics. In May 1522 110 went
with Charles to England (Brewer iii.
p. 969). In 1529 he was physician to
Al. Maurique, bp. of Seville; see the
preface to Vives' De Pacificatione, Ant-
werp, M. Hillen, 1529. His book on
the Astrolabe is commended in Vives'
De tradendis disciplinis, ibid„ J uly 1531,
bk. iv. He is commonly said to have
been professor of mathematics in the
College dc France: but Lefranc, Hist.
p. 131, shows that he was only attached
to the Court as physician to the Queen.
At the same time, c. 1530, he was
naturalized. In 1532 he produced a
Spanish translation of Cebes, made
from the Greek: printed at Paris by
S. Colinaeus. P. J. Olivarius dedicated
to him an edition of the Somnium Sci-
pionis, Poitiers‚ Manes, 1535, as ίΙο.
Martino Siliceo Poblacio, Christianis-
simae reginae Franciae primario
medico'.

Nevertheless he is probably not the
501110 person as Jo. Martinus Siliceus,
of the diocese of Badajoz‚ who was a
pupil of Vives' teacher, John Dullardus
(† 10 Sept. 1513), and who, 0. 1514,
dedicated to Al. Maurique, then bp. of
Badajoz (1499-1516), an Arithmetica,
which Vives praises in the De trad.
disciplinis, bk. iv. Siliceus also pro-
duced an edition of Swyneshed'sss. 74n)
Calculationes, Salamanca, J 0. de Porres,
24 April 1520: see Bonilla, Vives, pp.
418, 679. Later he became tutor to
Philip n, and then bp. of Murcia and
abp. of Toledo, †31 May 1557.

30. Menum] A Portuguese noble
(1490-27 April 1536), who had been
sent to study in Paris, and was especi-
ally interested in mathematics: see
the preface, 1 June (1515), to Graspar
Lax of Aragon's Arithmetica, Paris, H
le feure, 18 Dec. 1515. On return to
Portugal he was appointed tutor to the
King’s sonS, and continued his mathe-
matical studies. Some of these writings
survive in ms. 3 and some orations de-
livered by him on court festivals, 1525—
35, have been printed. He was with
the Court at Evora, when Olenardus
arrived there in 1534 (Clen. E. pp. 245-
6). See Barbosa, Bibl. Lusitana ii, 1747,
197-8 and Herculanos, Dice. bibl. Por-
tuyuez iii, 1859, 8-10, xi. 343.

Aquilinum] 1 cannot identify.

31. Enzinam] No John of this name
seems to be known in Paris at this time.
In view of the frequent errors that are
found in Christian names (cf. Ep. 1054
introd.) it is possible that the person
intended here is Ferd. de Enzinas os
Valladolid, author of many works on
logie which appeared in Paris between
