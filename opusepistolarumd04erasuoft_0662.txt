the payment of his salary. For some years he remained at Milan, regretful of
Avignon. and seeking in vain for an appointment in some Italian university,
preferably Padua. A high municipal office was offered to him ; but he declined,
wishing to be free for his studies. These were mainly legal : but he found time
to compose a comedy, Philarqyrus, to translate Ar. Nubes, and to hunt for mss. on
behalf of the Basle printers: with whom through Boniface he remained always
in close communication. At the end of 1527 he returned to Avignon, and taught
there till March 15293 when he accepted an invitation, pressed by the Arch- ’
bishop, Francis of Tournon (Ep. 1319), to come for two years to Bourges. In
1530 he began to negotiate for a chan· at Bologna3 but it was not till 1533 that
he sueoeeded in his ambition of an Italian post, when the Duke of Milan sent
him to Pavia, resisting an attempt of the Doge of Venice to secure him for
Padua. From 1537 to 1541 he taught at Bologna, 1541-3 at Pavia again, 1543—7
at Ferrara ; after which he returned to Pavia until his death. See Mazzuchelh,

Alciati's reputation was made early: see the honourable mentions in Zasius'
Lmzspratz‘onae, 1518, p. 17 (11μὸ621. 111 Mosellanus' Oratio cle linyzmrum coqnitz'one,

inserted in the Froben edition of Feb.1526, and 3836, added in March 1533 : also
many letters in ΖΕ, and Horawitz i. 17. His most important composition was
the legal treatise De verbormn siynfficatione‚ written as early as 1523, but not
printed till 1530, Lyons, S. Gryphius, with a dedication to Card. Tournon. In
his later years he produced a collected edition of his works‚ finely printed by
Isingrinius, Basle, 1546-9, in four volumes. He is best known through a volume
of about 200 Emblemata. or symbolic epigr-dms, which, when published with
illustrations‚ set the fashion of an ‘ emblem-literature ’, and were soon widely
imitated. The first edition appeared at Augsburg, H. Steyner, 28 Feb. 1531,
dedicated to Peutinger; and translations were made into French 1536, into
German 1542, into Italian and Spanish 1549, into English 1586. Altogether
about 180 editions of it are known : see an elaborate bibliography by H. Green,
1872. ’

Of his eorrespondence much remains. Ten letters exchanged with Erasmus
survive. There are 7 letters to 111111, 151ἓ-21, 111 the letter-book of Alex.
Minutianus at Milan (Bi-era MS. AD. XI. 31). Ρ. Burmann in M. Gudie Epistolue,
1697. pp. 75-114, printed 27 of 1115 letters, 1518-40, 26 of which are to F. Calvus
(Ep. 581. 3011). The Basle MS. G. ΙΙ. 14 contains 78 original letters from him
to Boniface Amerbach, 1521-49; of which 14 are printed by Giardini, and many
extracts given by Costa. Bonisace's replies are to be found in 63 rough drafts in
the Basle MSS. C. V12. 54 and 73 ; a few of which are printed in Am. Ε. Cian
prints 8 letters to Bembo, 1532-5‚ communicated by P. de Nolhac from the
Vatican MS. Bai-b. Lat. 2158 (xxxi. 43); and shows {hat the letters to Fran.
Alciati mentioned by Mazzuchelli as in the Visconti Library at Milan are now
in the Trivulziana there, hut are of little importance. The first letter in Jac. de
Boyssone's letter-book (Toulouse MS. 834) is from Alciati, 1534 ε see also Calc.
