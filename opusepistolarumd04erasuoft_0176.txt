132 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [15¹9

alienae potius famae incuriam demiror. Nam 93 epistola tametsi
poenitenda omnino mihi non est, tamen si eam editum iri existi·
massem, curassem mediusfidius vt cultior ac venustior de manibus
nostris 111 hominum ora prodiisset. Nunc quandoquidem quam tu

145 ad nos scripsisti, nostrae 111110 argumentum dedit, visum est eam per
te isthic iam euulgatam et hic quoque formis excusam nostrae ante-
ponere, vt ea perlecta, si qui forte erunt qui et nostris manus admo-
uere non perhorrescent, 111 11111115 intellectu minime haereant. Bene
vale, et me, vt soles, ama.

1046. To JOHN ROBYNS.

Epistolae ad diuersos p. 516. Louvain.
HN: Lond. xiii. 31 ε LB. 480. 1 December 1519.

[The researches of the late Prof. de Jongh elucidate this letter in a mo<
interesting manner. The difficulties 01 the professors of Busleiden's college and
of exter-nal teachers in general were not ended by the settlement 01 20 Sept. 1519
(Ep. 991. 3911). 111 accordance with the requirement 01 the University Rescius
(Ep. 546) had supplicated for incorporation, and therewith for licence to teach ;
but finding himself without colleagues, the Latin and Hebrew chairs being
temporarily vacant (ll. 28, 291111), 119 applied on 29 Nov. to have the considera-
tion of his case deserred. The Arts Faculty, too, following the example of the
Theologinns‚ were raising difficulties about unmatriculated students as well as
about unincorporated teachers ; and Nesen (Ep. 329), who had recently arrived
in Louvain with his pupils (Epp. 994. 9n, 1026. 9-10, 1034), was forbidden to
proceed with 3 course of lectures on Mela (l. 23n) which he had announced to
be given publicly at the Austin Friars.

According to modern standards such control by the University seems reason-
able ; but in an age of fluid and irregular conditions the requirements appeared
arbitrary and tyrannical, especially as they could be represented as aimed
against the new studies 01 humanism. In consequence among some of the
studente, feeling against the University and the Faculties ran high. On the
night of 29 Nov. between 9 and 10, four men armed rang at the house of the
Rector, John Calaber, and one of them, covering his face with his gauntlet.
thrust into the hand 01 the astonished servant a letter threatening violence to
the Rector and the Vice-Chancellor, Briard, unless the inhibition on Nesen
were immediately removed. Their letter delivered, the men ran off. But one
01 them had been recognized; and next day the Rector had Rescius arrested.
This action was approved by the University on 1 Dee, and at the same time
Rescius' application for incorporation which he wished to withdraw, was brought
forward and granted in his absence.

Evidently Erasmus had been mox-ed to invoke the aid 01 the Dean of Mechlin,
who, as intimately concerned with Busleiden's college (Epp. 805, 1001. 15-18)
might bc expected to protect one of its professors. There is 501119 reason to suppose
that the arrest of Rescius was wrongful, and that 119 may really not have had any
hand in the nocturnal visit to the Rector; for when Calaber's half-year of office.
was over, Rescius brought an action against him. The University decided to
support their officer 3 but as they could hardly do otherwise, their decision does
not throw much light 011 the rights of the case. The issue of the suit is not
known.

ments 01 the contest within the Univcrsity, Epp. 1057 introd.‚ 1240.]
