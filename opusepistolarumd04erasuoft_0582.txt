532 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1521

quod me prior ad amicitiam prouocaris. Nam in ea consuetudine
quae mihi tecum fuit Gandaui ac Dernemondae‚ tam me gessi
inciuiliter vt non semel veritus sim ne prorsus animum tuum a
nobis alienassem. At qui sic prouocatus amare potest, dignum
arbitror qui toto pectore redametur.

Sed Marcus Laurinus, decanus apud collegium Sancti Donatiani,
pollicitus est mihi vetustissimum codicem manu descriptum e vestra
bibliotheca, qui contineret commentarios diui Hieronymi in Psalmos.
Qui si commode ad nos mitti non potest, saltem optarem ex eo
describi Vnam aut alteram paginam: quo mihi collatione liceat
experiri num hi commentarii quos habemus excusos typis, adulterini
aut mutili sint necne. Quod si ne id quidem commodum est, arbi-
tror me ad Calendas Augustas Brugas repetiturum. Tum igitur vel
obiter salutabo tuam amplitudinem. Bene vale, pater omnibus
modis obseruande in Christo Iesu.

1215. To CHARLES HARST.

Epistolae ad diuersos p. 613. Anderlecht.
HN: Lond. xvi. 17: LB. 581. 22 June 1521.

[The year-date is confirmed by Erasmus’ residence at Anderlecht.

Charles Harst (1492-1563), of Wyssenbrfich in the diocese of Spires. inatri-
culated at Cologne 28 Oct. 1509, studied law at Orleans c. 1514-18 (Ep. 866. 511) ;
and at the present time evidently was at Louvain. Later in the year he accom-
panied Erasmus as far as Coblenz on the way to Basle (Ep. 1342. 176-8),
and carried back letters for him. In 1524 he spent some time in Eras-
mus' service at Basle (Ep. 1437), 111 company With Sig„ Gelenius : see the
latter-'s dedication to him (f‘). *3 νο) of Symmachus' Epz'stozae, Basle‚ Froben, Sept.
1549. He seems also to have acted as messenger for Erasmus: going to Rome
for him in Aug. 1525 (ΝΕ. pp. 2677 3 Epp. 1594—5‚ 1649-50) in connexion with a
dispensation to make a will, and to England in Dec. 1525 with aparcel of letters.
For the next two or three years he was teaching privately at Louvain 3 where he
married Katharine van der Klusen († 16 Jan. 1559), of whom Erasmus thought
well (Q. 57). For a time he was estranged froin Erasmus, whom he accused of
dcfaming him 3 but this did not last long. In March 1530 he entered the
service of Duke John of Cleves (Ep. 829. 1211) ; and the rest ot' his life was spent
in executive and diplomatic work for that family. In 1533 he visited Erasmus
at Freiburg (EE. 183 ; cf. Ep. 1313. 8511, and Lss. App. 373) ; but later was engaged
on missione ofhigher importance—to Fer-dinand in 1538, to Spain in 1539, to
England in 1540-4 as attendant on Anne of Cleves, but keeping no great state
(Brewer izv-xix), to the Emperor in 1544 (Brewer xix. i. 915), to England again
in 1547 and 1556. In 1552 116 settled at Dusseldorf; but he died at Xanten.

See five letters· from him to Boniface Amerbaeh, 1527-37 (Basle MSS. G. 11.
18. 92-6); Goclenii Epist„ ff. 3, 32 v⁰ 3 ΕΕ. and ADB.

Nicholas Epist-opius the younger (1531——29 Dec. 1565) dedicated to Harst the
first hook which he printed, an edition of Politian‘s Opera, Basle, 1553. In the
presace, dated 1 Sept„ he refers to a warni reception ‘ante aliquot annos in
