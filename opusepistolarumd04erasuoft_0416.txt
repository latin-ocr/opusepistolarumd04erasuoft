11541183 FROM ARTLEBUS OF BOSKOWITZ.

Breslau MS. Rhed. 2 54. 36. Znaim.
LB. App. 390. (c. October ‘? 1520.)

[An original letter, copied by a secreta ry but signed hythe writer. An approxi-
mate date can be assigned from Ep. 1183 : which shows that this letter was at
any rate received a considerable while after the visit of the emissaries of the
Brethren (Ep. 1117 introd.).

Artlebus', or Archlebus, of Boskowitz w. of Olnmtz, and owning estates at
Wranowa and Czernahora, NW. and sw. of Boskowitz, belonged to an ancient
family, which held a distinguished record in Bohemian history, and was con-
nected with George Podiebrad. One ofArtlebus' kinsfolk, Protasius of Boskowitz
and Czernahora, had been Bishop of Olmutz 1457-82 ; after education in Italy,
where he had been a friend of Janus Pannonius (Ep. 943. 15η), a pupil of
Galeottus Martius (Ep. 581. 6n), and an admirer of Valla. A Ladislaus of
Bozkowitz was Supreme Chamberlain of Moravia in 1499 ; and his sister Martha
had stood forward as a supporter of the Bohemian Brethren iu 1507-8. In
Gelasius Dobner's Mon. hist. Boemiae the names of ‘ Albertus de Bozkowicz et in
Lethowicz ³, ⁴ Benessius de Bozkowicz et de Czerne Hory ', occur in 1499 (iv. 475),
of ‘ Ioannes de Boskowitz et in skal ³ in 1512 (i. 266). Artlebus became Supremo
Captain of Moravia in 1519, and made a name by his vigorous suppression of the
brigandage which reigned there (cf. Epp. 1021. 59—73‚ 1039. 24-40) z see A. Pilarz
and F. Moravetz, Morauiae Historia, 1786, ii. 131, 173. But his tenure of the office
was brief, as he died in 1520 or 1521 ε see O. Steinbach, Diplomatz‘sche Sammcunq . . .
aus dem Archive (les qriislichen Cisterzz'enserstifls Saar in Mc'z'lzren, 1783, i. 55, 97. He is
probably the ‘Bohemian Captain' of Ep. 1263. 22.]
