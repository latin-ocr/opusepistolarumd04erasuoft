1200] ΤΟ WILLIAM FREDERICI 483

(pOfgthe youth of William Frederici (ψ 3 Aug. 1527), the famous Pastor of
St. Martin’s at Groningen, little is known. He was doubtless a kinsman of
John Frederici († p. 1484), curate of Zeerijp, from whom 116 inherited some
books. For many years he was in Italy with Rud. Agricola, whom he heard
lecture at Ferrara c. 1475-6 3 and 116 knew Agricola's family well (see Goswin of
Halen’s life of Agricola, Epp. 23. 5711, 839. 1111). By 1477 he was M.A. and
D.M., and secretary to the town of Groningen, and in 1484-5 116 became curate
of St. Martin's church: see Α. Gr. Roos, Cataloqus der Inczmabelen of Groningen
Univ. Library, 1912, nos. 18, 34, 90, 139. For forty years he held a dominating
position in the town, guiding its internai affairs, and by his eloquence playing
the chief part in its diplomacy: see Ubbo Emmius’ Rerum Frisicarum Historia,
Leiden, 1616. He retired from his cure at StsMartin’s in 1525 and passed his
two remaining years in the house of his son (l. 111) at Groningen.

In 1498 he began a history of Friesland, of which a nis. copy existe in the
Archives at Groningen. See a life by W. Zu1dema, 1888, and Ant. Matthaeus,
Vet. aeui-Analecta, iv (1738),pp. 527—8n. D. Gerdes, Hist. Reformationis, iii (1749‘,
Monuinenta pp. 3—5, prints some extracts from the Lamentationes Petri (Ep. 1236.
15011), which speak very highly of W. Frederici. He was a friend and patron of
Germ-d Lister; who sends greetings to him in dedicating his Commentarioli (Ep.
495 introd.) to Goswin of Halen, 13 Feb. 1520.]

DE iuuene reuocato non est quod mihi gratias agas, vir egregie.

1. iuuene] Eppendorff's note (App.
14, 110. 7) enables him to be identified
with Hieronymus Fridericus (Τ 26 Aug.
1558), son of Wm. Frederici. who after
studying at Freiburg at some time
during 1520-2‚ became LL.D.‚ it is not
known where. He settled at (11011111-
gen, married and had children, and
was ‘Rentineester’ of the town; see
Epp. 68, 69 in Clarorum virorum Epistolae‚
cd. S. Α. Gabbeina, 1669. Corn. Keni-
pius, to whom he lent a document,
inherited from liis father, for the Dr:
Oriqine Frisiae, 1588, pp. 154,157. praises
him for liis interest in antiquity ;

abroad. See Ant. Matthaeus, Veteris
aeui Analecta, iv (1738), p. 528n‚ and
W. Zuideina, 017. cit„ pp. 122, 152. He
is perhaps the iuuenis of Ep. 838. 7‚8.

On the present occasion Erasmus
evidently had been able to help his
friend by communicating with the
young man, perhaps through Eppen-
dorff, and securing his return home.
