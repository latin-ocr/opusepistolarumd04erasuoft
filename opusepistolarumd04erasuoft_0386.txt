338 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1520
1140. To MARTIN LrPsms.
Rotterdam MS„ Erasmus III. 102, p. 47. (Βουναία)

Horawitz v. 12. <‘? September 1520.)

[Only a conjectura] date is possible, based on the movements of Lee. In J uly
he met Erasmus at Calais (Ep. 1132. 1811). 111 Ep. 1139 the suggestion seems to
be that he had left Louvain ε in Ep. 1165. 25 he is certainly in England.]

DES. ERAS. ROTE. SVO LYPSIO.

<S>1 non est aliud incommodum nisi quod Origenes nimis magnum
est volumen, nihil est periculi. De Priore diue Agnetis nihil vnquam
sinistri sum suspicatus, sed de fratribus Zwollensibus‚ quanquam hoc
quoque leuiter. De vxore Listrii deque omissis Graecis literis com-
peri falso ad me scriptum fuisse, et expostulaui cum eo qui scri-
pserat; nam is est Listrio cum primis amicus.

Admonuit me Agnetanus de Augustino, sed humanissime; nec
sum tam morosus vt huiusmodi admonitionibus offendar. Si nondum
satisfeci animo illius, non sum tam felix vt omnium animis satis-
faciam. Non postulabat ille locus vt Augustini laudes attollerem.
Et malo nonnullis paulo minus candidus videri in Augustinum
quam euincere me multo candidiorem esse quam istis videar.
Honestus est affectus quo tenetur D. Prior ; fauet enim autori suo.
Sic Thomam nemo satis laudat Praedicatoribus. Postremo tot habeo
fauentes, tot aduersantes, vt vix vacet de vno aut altero esse solli-
citum.

Leeus iam abiit, opinor, in Angliam re preclare gesta.

Lister: perhaps that his wife, sor
