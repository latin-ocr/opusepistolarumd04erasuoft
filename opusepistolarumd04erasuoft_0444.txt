Rursum vale.

Saluta Carinum meum et Hertmanum. Cum dabitur certus nun-

rursus9 vt spero, in Martio. Permisi Comiti Nouae Aquilae vt tuas
litteras resignaret, et eas rursus obsignaret suo signo.

1166. ΤΟ —

( Louvain.)

LB. App. 511. <December 1520.)

[This letter, like Epp. 681, 1208, is one of the few for which 1 have no earlier
source than LB„ but which probably came from the Deventer Letter-book (see
vol. i, p. 609). The oontents show that it is contemporary with Epp. 1164,
1165, 1174. The person addressed was evidently a man of position, with whom
Erasmus had not yet corresponded, and was familiar with Dorp. Erasmus
may also have had reason to know that he was interested in affairs in Holland ;
but beyond this the letter. which is incomplete‚ gives no clue. Either Meynard
Manu (Ep. 304. 161n) or Hugo of Assendelft (Ep. 1044. 2611) or Cornelius Hoen
(cf. Ep. 1358. 2611) or Bernard Bucho (Ep. 1237) satisfies these conditions3 but
the evidence is not sufficient to confirm such conjecture]

ERASMVS ROT. . .

Qvo magis mecum reputo quam nihil est in fortunis meis quod
tuum fauorem aut emeruerit vnquam aut emerere possit in posterum,
hoc magis admiror genuinum animi tui candorem, qui cum crebro
in tuis ad Dorpium litteris nostri facias mentionem, nunc etiam

5 epistola propria dignatus sis, praesertim in tantis negotiorum vndis

assidue versans.
eram adscitus.

In ordinem consiliariorum iam ante triennium
Tantum deerat diploma Principis, in cuius vicem

Ioannes Syluagffls, quondam Cancellarius, suam interposuerat fidem:

1165. 46. Germanis] Cf. Ep. 1110.67n.
Aleandro] Before long Erasmus
seems to have modified this view: for
on 29 March 1521 Capito, writing to
Aleander ofan interview he had had at
Frankfort with a supporter of Erasmus
and Luther, mentions as one of the
arguments with which he had con-
vinced his opponent of Aleander's
moderate attitude. ‘ optime tibi cum
Erasmo conuenire. Produxi in hoc
literas illius ad me, quibus tui com-
meminit honorifioe'. See P. Kalk0ff‚
W. Capito‚19o7‚ p. 135.
47. fio Gallus] Cf. Ep. 1147. 28n.
49. Carinum] See Ep. 920 introd.
Hertmanum] of Halwi13 see Ep.
561. 63n.

51. Permisi] Cf. the way in which
Ep. 867 was shown to numerous friends
along the road before it was delivered
to Beatus at Basle z see Epp. 877-83.

Comiti] See Ep. 442 introd.

1166. 6. ante triennium] This state-
ment, which is repeated in Ep. 1174. 9,
appears to be another example of Eras-
mus’ habitual inaccuracy in regard to
figures (cf. Ep. 1143. 25n) ; for his
appointment as councillor to Chai-les
dated back to 1515—16 (see Ep. 370. 18n).
It is possible that he was thinking of
the interval between his nomination
and the death of Le Sauvage in June
1518 (Ep. 410) ; hut the wording of
Ep. 1174 makes such an interpretation
difficult.
