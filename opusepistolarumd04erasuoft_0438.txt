LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1520

1163. To ADRIAN BARLAND.

Epistolae selectae, 1520, f0. M.

Louvain.
30 November 1520.

[This and Ep. 646 are the two letters in Barland's Epistolae aliquot selecfae ex
Erasmz'cis, Dec. 1520 (see App. 12 in vol. iii) which are not known from any
other source. The volume was being prepared for use in schools, and was to
consist mainly ofa selection from the Fam-ayo (E). In view of the date of the
book, the year-date of this letter needs 110 confirmation]

ERASMVS BARLANDO SVO S. P.

NON dubito quin tua prudentia selegerit eas epistolas quae nihil
habeant aculeorum: nam vides vt hodie quidam ad quamlibet occa-

sionem irritentur.

Quanquam optassem tibi aliud consilium venisse

in mentem z nam vereor ne hoc ipsum male habeat eos, quod videant
5 aliquid meum in 11οο parari, vt praelegatur in scholis.

Ego aegre impeti-aui a typographis ne rursus aederent Farraginem.
Eam recognoui sublatis nonnullis, quibusdam etiam mitigatis; vt
sic potius exeat quam vt ante fuit excusa, non autore me, sed tamen
111 hoc amicorum affectibus indulgente.

Displicet quod Theodericus recusarit excudere librum M. N. Tu-

renhout.

Primum praestabat 11011 indicare suum animum. Deinde
multis nominibus vellem 1100 opus exire.

Vir est rei theologicae

cum primis peritus, 1100 dubito quin vt disputauit, ita et scripserit,

solidis argumentis rem gerens, non conuiciis.

Et vt non probabam

15 Lutherum vociferationibus et conspirationibus opprimi, ita maxime
vellem illum sacrae Scripturae testimoniis verisque rationibus re·

20

uinci.

Vt plurimum tribuatur Bullae pontificiae, tamen haec res
magis moueret eruditos aut etiam ingeniosos.

Suadebis igitur

homini ne recuset posthac : ego pro mea quoque virili idem conabor.

Bene vale.

Louanii. Natali diui Andreae.

 

 

3. irritentur] Cf. Ep. 1159. 22-3.

6. ne rursus aederent] i.e. without
revision by the author : see Epp. 1040,
1206 introdd.

10. Theodericus] Martens. For an-
other refusal by him see Ep. 1030. 10—
11.

Turenhout] John Driedo «ΓΙ-4 Aug.
1535) of Turnhout, 20 ms. E. of Antwerp,
was now one of the rising theologians
of Louvain. He had been educated at
the College du Faucon, and was first in
the promotion of 1499. 011 17 Aug.
15¹2 he proceeded D.D., and soon
became professor oftheology. Between
1515 and 1531 110 was six times dean of
the Faculty of Theology3 in 1528 and
1533 rector of the University 3 and
from 1519 to 1529 President of the
college d’Houterle. At some period
he was resident tutor to the youthful
Charles Croy (c. 1508—1564],brot11er of

An. M.D.Xx.

the Cardinal Abp. of Tolede (see Epp.
492, 647 introdd.j. He wrote some
considerable works of dogmatic theo-
logy ; two of which were published in
1533-4, and the rest by his friends after
his death. There is also a collected
edition by Ruard Tapper (Ep. 946. 311),
printed by Barth. Gravius, Louvain‚
1552-6. See Val. Andreas, pp. 100, 302 ;
and de Jongh, pp. 156-9.

The estimate of him here as a fair
and moderate controversialist is re-
peated in Epp.1164, 1167, 11733 but Ep.
1 165. 28-9 gives a different view. The
book which Mal-tens refused to under-
take, was never printed. It was prob-
abl y a refutation of Luther's Conclusiones‚
and may have been delivered as an
oration at tho beginning of the October
term 1519: soc de Jongh, pp. 158, 159
n. 8.
