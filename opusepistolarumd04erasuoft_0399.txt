1146. To JOHN ALEXANDER BRAssmANUS.

Musae et Gratiae 1²0. A2. Antwerp.
26 September 1520.

[At some date after 13 Sept. (Epp. 1143,4*) Erasmus went to Antwerp, where
he stayed, as usual, with Gilles. His purpose was, no doubt, to be ready for the
visit of Charles v, which had been announced for 15 Sept. (Brewer iii, App. 14),
but did not take place till 23-28 Sept. (Gachard ii. 28). It appears that Brassi-
canus called upon him and succeeded in obtaining the following letter of com-
pliment, which is of the same class as Epp. 874, 875, 981, 985. Next day he visited
the friends again, and enjoyed conversation with Erasmus: one of whose remarks
he noted down on the spot. This he afterwards sent to Vadianus, among whose
correspondence at St. Gallen it is preserved ( VE. 219). It runs:

‘Ioannes Alexander Brassicanus rogauit Erasmum qua ratione doctus posset
fieri. Respondit ex tempore : si doctis assidue conuiueret, si doctos audiret non
minus submisse quam honorifice, si doctos strenue legeret, si doctos diligenter
edisceret, denique si se doctum nunquam putaret.

‘Antwerpiae, in aedibus domini Petri Aegidii, anno a nato Iesu MDXX, mensis
anris die xxvn.’

Subsequently Brassicanus printed the present letter in a volume entitled Musae
et Gratiae, Vienna, J. Singren, 9 July 1524. and dedicated to John Faber (ΕΡ. 386
introd.), his friend and patron, who was now Ferdinand's minister.

John Alexander Brassicanus (Kol t 1500 or 1 -25 Nov. 1539) matriculated in
Jan. 1514 at Tubingen‚ where his father had taught in the town-school, and was
MA. 21 July 1517. He continued in the University, teaching on humanistic
lines ; but c. May 1519 went off in the train of Maximilian of Bergen, ambassador
of Charles v (ΜΗΕ. 111. 22,3). ΗΕ. 181 shows that he made the acquaintance of
Hutten. Just at this time he visited Erasmus, and returned with him to
Louvain, where on 8 Oct. he witnessed the burning of Luther's books (Ep. 1157.
6n); and subsequently he went on to Cologne (BRE. 189). From Dec. 1520
(ibid.) to Jan. 1521 (ΥΕ. 233, 238) 110 was at Constance, staying with John
Faber, then Vicat-General, to avoid an outbreak of plague at Tubingen ι bur, oy
May he had returned to his University, where he began to study law (ΟΕ.
ii. 1-4), and where he gained the praise of Reuchlin as ‘ vtilis eruditor ’ (ΜΗΕ.
iv. 44). On Reuchlin's death, 30 June 1522, Brassicanus was invited to succeed
him as Professor of Philology at Ingolstadt ; by 19 Oct. he was 111 office, and by
6 Nov. had become LL.D. (MHE. iii. 54). But- he was not happy there; and
though afterwards, like Faber, a staunch Catholic, he incurred for a time su-
spicions of favouring Luther. In consequence, with Faber's aid, be secured in
April 1524 an invitation to Vienna ; where he was installed in the King's College,
and taught successively Rhetoric, Civil Law, and Greek. The important work
of his life was the discovery of Mss. Between 1524 and 1526 110 accompanied
several missions to the court of Louis of Hungary, and took the opportunity to
examine the library of Matthias Corvinus at Buda : which was doomed shortly
to fan into Turkish hands. He was allowed to carry away with him a number
of mss. ; others he discovered in the abbey of Melk, on the Danube above Vienna.

Among the numerous publications of his early years there was, as Erasmus·
said (Lond. xx. 66, LB. 966), nothing memorable. But in 1529= so far as ill-
health allowed, he began a series of patristic publications, works of Gennadius,
Salvianus, Eucherius, Haymo, Potho, based on mss. he had found. In the
preface to Salvianus, Basle, Froben. Aug. 1530, he describes what he saw of
the library at Buda; in Eucherius, ibid„ Aug. 1531, f0. aa² v⁰, 110 attributes the
destruction at Vienna to German troops rather than to the Turks.

With Erasmus his relations were at first most agreeable. One of his earliest
acts after his degree was to make a copy of the Iulius Echuszw, 24 Aug. 1517 (Ep.
502 introd.); in 1520 came the present visit; in 1522 they were in friendly
correspondence (GE. ii. 5, 6) ; in 1529 he lectured on one of the Colloquies
(vienna MS. 10575, ff. 60-80). But in 1533 bitterness had intervened (LB. App.
372). Whether this lasted to the end is not clear. In a preface, 6 Feb. 1539,
to Hugo Eterianus' De anima corpore iam exuta, Cologne, Gymnicb, 1540, Brassi-
canus writes with good feeling of the master whose opinion of Hugo he is glad
