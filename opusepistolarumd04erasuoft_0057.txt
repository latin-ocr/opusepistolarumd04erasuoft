nuit, licet alio vocantibus amicorum consiliis. Paucis mensibus a
funere vxoris viduam duxit, magis curandae familiae quam voluptati,
quippe nec bellam admodum nec puellam, vt ipse iocari solet, sed
acrem ac vigilantem matrem familias3 quicum tamen perinde
comiter suauiterque viuit ac si puella foret forma quantumlibet
amabili. Vix vllus maritus a sua tantum obsequii impetrat imperio
atque seueritudine quantum hic blanditiis iocisque. Quid enim non
impetret, posteaquam effecit vt mulier iam ad senium vergens, ad
hoc animi minime mollis. postremo ad rem attentissima, cithara,
testudine, monochordo, tibiisque canere disceret, et in hisce rebus
cotidie praescriptum operae pensum exigenti marito redderet ‘?
Consimili comitate totam familiam moderatur, in qua nulla tra-
goedia, nulla rixa. Si quid extiterit, protinus aut medetur aut com·
ponit ; neque quenquam vnquam dimisit vt inimicum aut vt inimicus.
Quin huius domus fatalis quaedam videtur felicitas, in qua nemo
vixit qui non prouectus sit ad meliorem fortunam, nullus vnquam
vllam famae labem contraxit. Quin vix vllos reperias quibus sic
conuenerit cum matre vt huic cum nouerca—nam pater iam alteram
induxerat ; vtranque non minus adamauit ac matrem. Nuper
induxit tertiam: hac Morus sancte deierat se nihil vnquam vidisse
melius. Porro erga parentes ac liberos sororesque sic affectus est, vt

nec amet moleste nec vsquam desit officio pietatis.

Quintilian ; and by Cresacre More, sze
os Moore,(1631)‚ p. 189, with a transla-
tion of Eusebius. But none of these
have survived.

175. Aloysia] The name of More’s
second daughter, who became the wife
of Wm. Daunce, was Elizabeth ; as
Erasmus rightly has in his pref-ace to
the Nux. The inaccuracy here probably
arose from confusion with her step-
sister (cf. Ep. 1233. 58n) ; but as these
names were not inserted until H, it was
not corrected like those in ll. 174, 211.
It appears also in Erasmus’ preface to
Aristotle, 27 Feb. 1531 (Lond. xxviii.
13, LB. 1159).

Cecilia] Afterwards the wife of
Giles Heron.

Ioannes] (c. 1509-1547), More’s
youngest child; who in Sept. 1521 was
about 13 (Ep. 1233. 61). At Christmas
1523 Erasmus dedicated to him the
poem Nux, attributed to Ovid. Besides
that it is striking that the young man
received the dedications of the second
editions of both Aristotle and Plato in
the Greek—the former corrected by
Grynaeus, with a preface by Erasmus
(Lond. xxviii. 13, LB. 1159), Basle‚ J.
Bebel, 13 April 1531 ; the latter (with
Proclus’ commentaries) corrected by

John Oporinus, with a prefaee by
Gry-naeus, Basle, J. Valder, March 1534,
based in part on mss. brought by
Grynaeus from England. Nevertheless,
on quite inadequate evidence, it has
been supposed that he was of weak
intellect. About 1529 he married Anne
Cresacre (1511-77), and Cresacre More
(1572—1649) was his grandson. See
DNB. xxxviii. 447.

176. Paucis mensibus] John Bonge,
who was 111 a position to know (see 1.
16111), says ‘ within a monythe after ' :
in a letter written in 1535 (ΕΗΒ. vii.
714). Cf. Ep. 221. 3111.

177. viduam] Alice, widow of John
Middleton († c. 4 Oct. 1509), citizen and
mercer of London, and merchant of the
Staple of Calais—information which 1
owe to Mr. A. W. Reed. More married
her in 1511 (cf. Ep. 236. 47n>3 and
after his execution she received from
the Crown an annuity for life.

178. nec bellam] Cf. Mart. 1. 64. 4.

187. familiam] By 1521 this included
also two of his daughters’ husbands:
cf. Ep. 1233. 7211.

193. nouerca] See 1. 6111.

196. sorores] Johanna, born 1 1 March
14795, and married to Rich. Stafl'reton ;
Agatha, born 31 Jan. 1473 ; Elizabeth,
