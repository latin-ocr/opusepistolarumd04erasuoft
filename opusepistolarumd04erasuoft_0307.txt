cum hoc animo coniunctum, non impune sic imponerent mundo isti
nescio quid addam. Seditionem non amo. Caetera praestabo pro
viribus.

Iam adessem in Germania; sed remoratur me Regum conuentus.
Expectatur indies Carolus. Rex Anglus et Gallus adornant collo-

vigilans. Non sum is qui possim iudicare de Lutheri scriptis.
Sed hec tyrannis mihi nullo pacto placet. Bene vale, charissime

[In response to Erasmus' appeal to his friends to write conciliatory letters to
Dorp (ef. Ep. 1044. 49n), Zasius (1. 24) stimulated Botzheim to write to both
Erasmus and Dorp ε letters which were on their way by 6 March 1520 (ΖΕ. 21).
Further encouragement came from Urbanus Rhegius (l. 2). This, which is
. evidently Erasmus’ first letter to Botzheim—-in the three inaccuracies in Botz-
heim's name F probably reproduces Erasmus’ rough-draft or a copy made from

it by a secretary—, is therefore his reply to Botzheim's advance.
The year-date added in H can be corrected from Paee's succession to Cole

(ἦ- 16 Sept. 1519).]

8. nescio] For this periphrasis cf.
Ep· 732- 43· ,

10. Germania] Cf. Epp. 1078. 6211,
1101. 1. Just about this time Erasmus
seems to have received an invitation to
teach at Leipzig3 cf. Luther to Spala—
tinus, 31 May 1520 (LE.2 308), ‘Lip-
senses anxii pro retinendis scholaribus
iactant Erasmum ad se venturum '.
Enders notes that after the Leipzig
Disputation (Ep. 1020. 6211)
students had migrated from Leipzig to
XVittenberg.

11. Carolus] See Ep. 1079. 9n.

12. caleti] See Ep. 1106. 92n.

Cantuariensis] Cf. BRE. 166.

13. pene arserant] Cf. Ep. 1 113. 16-20;
where Erasmus= claims to have prevailed
with Wolsey against this step. 'When
urged to it from Rome, WVolsey replied
at first that he had not the requisite
powers (Brewer iii. 1210); but later,
under pressure, he complied (ibid. 1234;

many Δ

cf. 1193, 1197). On 122 May 1521
Luther's books were publicly burned
at St. Paul’s Cross (ibid. 1273.4) 3 and
at the same time mandates were sent
out to the bishops to collect them and
transmit them to London (ibid. 1279).
See P. Smith in EHR. xxv. 657‚8.
Capito reported to Aleander, 29 March
1521, ⁴ apud Anglos <Lutlierii> nomen
inire frigere, siquidem nemo bonus vel
legere dignatur tam atros affectus':
see P. Kalkoff‚ W. Capito, p. 135. The
sermon preached by Fisher at the
burning was translated into Latin by
Pace3 who sent it in nis. to Leo x with
a letter from Richmond, 1 June sBahm
no. 98). Later it was printed by
Siberch at Cambridge, (c. 1 Jan.) 152>ss.

14. amiculus] It appears from Ep.
1 1 13. 17-20 that Erasmus means himself.

18. Leo] See p. 110.

19. Pamphi-asim] Ep. 1112.

22. publicanus] Luke 18. 10.
