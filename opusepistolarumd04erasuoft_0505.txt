1194. To THE READER.

De contemptu mundi, tit. v0. <Louvain.>
Lond. xxix. 47 : LB. v. 1239. <March ¹? 1521.)

[The preface to the De contemptu mundi epistola, quam conscripsit adolescens in qratiam
ac nomine Theoderici Harlemci‚ canonici· ordinis diui Auyustini. Ex ipsius autoris re-
coynz'tione ε Louvain, Th. Martens, 1521 (a). The account thus given, and
amplified in this preface, is borne out by the description in 1, p. 18. 16-19. Luc.
Ina. distinguishes between the libellas now published, and a Declamatio in vti-amque
partem, qua simulet dissuadet vitam monasticam, ac moa: suadem which Erasmus had
composed in Bologna c. 1507, perhaps in expansion of the libellus. He was 111-
clined to be pleased with it, and in 1523 was prepared to publish it; but the
pages at beginning and end were missing (see 1, p. 37. 2—7).

The theme was common enough in medieval times; and numerous cssays upon
it survive. St. Bernard's De contemptu mundi was so popular that it was printed
seven times in the fifteenth century ; Innocent 111's De miseria conditionis humanae,
which has this subtitle, seventeen times. It may be noted, too, that the second
title of ch. i of the Dc Imitatione Christi is ‘ De contemptu omnium vanitatum
mundi ³. Another may be mentioned from its similarity in circumstances to the
present case ; by John of Schoenhoven, Austin canon of Groenendael near
Brussels (cf. vol. i, p. 590) for his nephew, William Vriman, a Carthusian near
Utrecht: the ms. of which was bought by Ferdinand Columbus (see p. 353) in
Cologne, Feb. 1522, and is now 111 the Colombina at Seville (5. 3. 32).

In addition to α 1 have collated an edition by Hillen at Antwerp, s. a„ (Β).
Erasmus revised the treatise for reprint in the Froben De pueris instituendis, Sept.
1529 (γ) : for the loan of which Ι am again indebted to the generosity of Mr. Τ.
Loveday, jun., of &Villiamscote In the Basle Opera of 1540, v. 1034 (ὃ), there is a
variant in this preface which marks out that edition as the source of Lond.

The book itself contains no definite evidence of date. Verses from Rud.
Agricola and Hegius are quoted (chh. vi, ix), and there are frequent references
to Jerome. In ch. vii it is said that war has been going on continuously in
Holland for twenty-three years; but Ι cannot find any certain term from which
to reckon this. Theodore of Haarlem was no doubt a real person (cf. 11. 9-10),
though the names of him and his nephew may be fictitious. If Erasmus’ memory
can be trusted. the treatise must have been written c. 14863 during the years
when he had returned to Gouda, and was in communication with, but hesitating
to enter, Steyn. For relations between Steyn and Haarlem see Ep. 33 inti-od.
The final chapter—perhaps, as Blok suggests (Hist. Netherlands, tr. R. Putnam, ii.
1907, pp. 298-9), added at a later date—tempers much of what had been said
earlier in the book in praise of the monastic life, by calling attention to its
dangers.

For this preface only a conjectural date is possible within the limits of 1521.
It may be placed with Ep. 1193, which is also a preface to some of Erasmus'
earlier writings.]
