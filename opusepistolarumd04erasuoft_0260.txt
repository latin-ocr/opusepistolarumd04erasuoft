216 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1520
stultius neque indoctius: et tamen homo sibi placet, et inuenit quod
in(docti> applaudunt. Respondimus ex tempore illius inuectiuis:
ad quas si conferantur scripta Hoechstrati et Pefercorni, nihil sunt
nisi merum mel. Nos, quod ad rem attinet, satis strenue nos

10 gessimus in refellendo. Ceterum quomodo monstrum hoc natum
in perniciem bonorum studiorum, sit a vobis expediendum, ex
amicorum litteris cognoscet-is, quibus hoc negocii dedimus.

Nisi pestis nos deterrebit, fortassis hoc vere toti commigrabimus
in Germaniam. Interea cura vt quam optime valeas, amice magne

15 et patrone incomparabilis. Louanii 14. Galen. Aprilis.

Erasmus ex animo tuus, raptim.

(Louvain.)
(c. 25 March 1520.)

[Between the Apologia qua respondet and the first Responsio acl Annotationes Lei,
which Hillen printed in (March) and April 1520 (pp. 109, 1 10). As Erasmus cor-
rected the proofs of these (1, p. 22. 22), it seems clear that when this letter was
written, he was about to start for Antwerp to see the first Responsio through the
press. His visit to Antwerp for the printing of the Apozoyia is to be dated c. 8-1 5
March (Ep. 1077 introd.). The second Responsio was in the press there on ¹7 April
(Ep. 1092); and 110 was already at Antwerp on 13 April (Ep. 1091). For the
printing of the first Responsio therefore an intermediate date seems probable ε so
that the Tuesday fixed for his departure (l. 7) may be taken conjecturally as
27 March. On 9 April Erasmus was at Louvain again (Ep. 1088), and preparing
for his third visit to Antwerp on this business 3 cf. Ep. 1094. 10-11.]

sororis. A son-in-law of Pirckheimer
visited Holland early in 1520 (Heu-
mann p. 48 = HE. 174) ε probably
Jo, Imhof (τ 1526), who by 1521 was
married to Felicitas Pirckheimer (see
Zedler xiv. 581).

12. dedimus] Erasmus had consented
to-or may even have suggested (cf. Ep.
999. 3 18-2o)—a volume of letters against
Lee, such as shortly came into being as
ΕΑΒ (p. 210). Of the letters therein
only one, More’s to Lee of 1 May 1519,
could now have been seen by Erasmus ε
most were not yet written.

13. pestis] For the ravages of this at
Basle in the autumn of 1519 see some

very informing letters from Alb. Burei·
to Beatus (BRE. 124, 125, 128, 129y 133).

14. Germaniam] Cf. Ep. 1078. 62n.

Lee (szot. 39 on Erasmus' note on
1111110323) had cited Gregory¹s De Christi
μενιεαῖοῃία, ll. 30-32, to the effect that
J oseph had two fathers, as here stated.
Erasmus in his first Resmnsz'o, Annot. 39,
brushed Gregory's authority aside: no
doubt as the result of Lypsius' reply to
this question. His original note onLuke
3. 23 stands unchanged in all later edi-
tions of his Annot. in. N. T. The name,
as copied here by Lypsius, is found in
the Aldine edition (Ep. 352. 3111).
