622 APPENDIX XV

Aug. 1520 he set out from Alcala for Rome, where he arrived
on 9 Feb. 1521: see his Itinerarium dedicated to his brother,
J oannes Stunica. who was a Knight of the Order of Santiago, Rome,
M. Silber, 1522 (reprinted by Andr. Schottus, Hispaniae Bibliotheca.
1608, pp. 624—49). Silber also printed for him in the same year an
Epistola to Adrian VI (Panzer viii. 265). Stunica continued at Rome
his attacks upon Erasmus' work; and in consequence his name
appears frequently in Erasmus' correspondence, with great obloquy.
But after some years better feeling prevailed: and instead of pub-
lishing the criticisms which he had made upon Erasmus' fourth
edition of the New Testament, 1527, Stunica proposed to commu-
nicate them to him privately. From this he was prevented by his
death, which occurred at Naples about the end of 1531 z see cap. 32
of Sepulveda's Antapozoyia pro Alberto Pio in Erasmum, Rome,
A. Bladus, 1532 (Panzer viii. 275), and Sep. Ε. 11. 1 and 2, cf. ΕΕ. 176.
The Antapoloyia mentions also (cap. 19) that c. July 1529 Stunica
and Sepulveda accompanied Cardinal Quignon on his mission to
meet Chai-les v at Genea: cf. J. Wickham Legg, Second Recension of
tlte Quiynooz Breviary, 1912, p. 96. During the Imperial visit Oholer
saw him at Bologna and formed a good opinion of his feelings
towards Erasmus (EE2. 80). See Nic. Antonio, Bibl. Hispana noua,
i, 1783, pp. 295-63 and A. Bludau, Erccsmzis-Aicsgyabeii des N. T„
1902, pp. 125-40.
