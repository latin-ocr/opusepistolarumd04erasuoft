Antwerp.
11 August 1519.

[Since Sept. 1514 (RE. 192) Hochstrat (Ep. 290. 1011) had been at Rome
engaged in the affair of Reuchlin ; but in the summer of 1517 he had recently
returned (Ep. 615. 10,11), the case having come to a standstill (ef. Ep. 622. 3211).
Already in May 1517 he had threatened ‘persecution ” of Erasmus for the Nouum
Instrumentzmz (HE. 51, ξ 7); and some report of this had perhaps reached
Erasmus’ ears. They had never met (Ep. 856. 31-2) ; but Erasmus knew enough
of Hochstrat's part in hai-assing Reuchlin to have been tempted often to inter-
vene with a protest (Ep. 856. 27-451, and to have strong feelings against him
(Ep. 877. 16-31). At length when the Desimctio Gabale appeared (l. 74n),
publicly attacking the views on divorce expressed in the Nouzmz Instrumentwn,
1516, Erasmus felt compelled to reply with what he considered an apoloqia,
though of a friendly character (cf. Ep. 1022. 14—17), rather than a letter (ef.
p. 10), defending himself anew, although he had already stated his opinions
more definitely (0121. 20311). 111 replying to Lce, Annot. 12 (LE. ix. 138 Ε),
Erasmus refers to this letter as containing his views on divorce. ’

By the middle of Oct. 1519 Erasmus had had no answer to this letter. Feeling
that there was still reason to complain of Hochstrat's attitude (cf. Epp. 1030.
1611, 1040. 2-6), he made another attempt to approach him through Gratius
(Ep. 1022). A passage in the Spoozqia (cf. Ep. 1078. 3811) shows that these
negotiations were successful. Later on they had two interviews at Louvain,
perhaps in Jan. 1520 after the death of Atensis3 for in explaining his action
Hochstrat sheltered himself behind Atensis' authority. After that some degree
of intimacy appears to have arisen between them; for in Ep. 1342. 614—15
Erasmus speaks of Hochstrat as ‘ vetus meus, si non familiaris, certe amicus '.
