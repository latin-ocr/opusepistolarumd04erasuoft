iv PREFAOE

the aid of three friends to whom I am infinitely indebted. It
is difficult to express the large share that INGRAM BYWATER took
in this work, especially in whatever concerned the history of
scholarship, the attention with which he considered the proofS,
and tho frequent enrichment of the commentary which he supplied
from his great erudition, reinforced by the library which he had
himself collected, and the choicest books of which, many thousandS‚
he destined for and bequeathed to the Bodleian. It is impossible
to forget, though it is not easy to live up to, the standard of
severe and exact scholarship that he set as indispensable in an
edition of this kind. CHARLES CANNAN, as Secretary to the
Delegates, gave me from my first beginning every encourage-
ment, At his side it was almost a pleasure to have difficulties
arise : from the sure and certain sense which he always imparted,
not only that the difficulties were to be faced at once, but that
they would in the end be surmounted. A keen and penetrating
scholar, with the patience of a leader who is master of himself
and of those around him, he was rightly placed at the head of an
institution whose care it‘is to provide for the great aims of a
University-sound education and useful learning. Ι am bound
also to mourn for WILLIAM OSLER‚ most brilliant and inspiring
of men, πολλῶν ἀντάξιος ἄλλων; indeed ‘the Wellbeloved', the
fire of whose enthusiasm warmed the hearts and quickened the
intelligence of those to whom he extended his very present help.
It is a matter of the keenest regret to me to be able to testify
my gratitude to them only at a distance.
To the names of the friends and allies mentioned in previous
volumes I am happy to add more, not without pleasant recollec-
tion in many cases of charming hospitality:
in Belgium, Prof. Cauchie and his devoted secretary M. Isidore
Versluys in the College du Saint-Esprit‚ and Prof. De Vocht
(who has been especially genereus in communicating to me
his latest discoveries‚ and above all, the Lctters to Crane-
velt which he is about to publish) in the College du Pape,
at Louvain3 M. Paul Bergmans, Director of the University
Library, and Canon Claeys-Bouwaert of the Se'minaire, at
Ghent 3 and M. Henry Vcrcruysse at Courtray.

in France, M. Georges Gazier, one of the re-captors of Fort
Vaux, Director of the Bibliotheque Publique at Besancon3
M. Julien Feuvricr‚ Archiviste of Dole; M. Louis Polain
of Pari-<33 and M. Renaudet, now Professor at BordeauX.
