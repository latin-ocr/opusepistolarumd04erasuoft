302 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1520
nugis meis quas in 1. ii de orig. iur. pro nouitiis congessi, nimium
quam intentus, parum amice ad me scripsit: cui non segniter
respondi. Exemplar vtriusque mitto: quae ‘tamen edere non est
consilium, quod officio quam conuiciis cum bonis viris certare malim.

Regis nostri humanitati qua mihi nunc frui datum est, pro virili
respondere conabor. Senex enim quamuis sim, difficillimas tamen
iuris ciuilis lectiones non sine fama mei et nouo et eleganti modo
profiteor. Nam vtut vires deficiant, ingenio nihilo magis destituor.
Cup-erem vero a regentiae onere feriari, vt eo quietior studiis in
auditorum meorum vtilitatern possem intendere. Qua in re si me

aldiuueris, te me beasse lubens confitebor. Vale ad salutem mortalium
iu sanus.

Ex Frib. 111. Id. Iulii. Anno M.D.xx.

1122. To MATTHIAS MEYNER.

Louvain. ·
30 July 1520.

Epistolae selectae, 1520, f0. M (a).
F. p. 510: HN: Lond. xiii. 20: LB. 514.

[For the first source see App. 12 in vol. iii. The year-date given in the text is
probably correct, but I cannot establish it as certain. It is corroborated by Ep.
1125, and by the fact that neither letter appears in the Farraqo (E). But Erasmus
was at Louvain at the end of July in 1517 and 1519 also. Thedate of Barland's
volume precludes any later year than 1520. ῃ

The person here addressed omitted to add his surname (cf. ll. 19-20) in writing
to Erasmus3 and in consequence he has hitherto, so far as Ι know, eluded
identification. The title decimarius shows that he was one of the superintendents
appointed by the dukes of Saxony to control the silver mines; cf. the Ber-mannus
(1. 1211), p. 131. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that he was a certain
Matthias Meyner of Chemnitz, superintendent of the mines at Schneeberg, to
whom on 5 Nov. 1522 Mosellanus dedicated an edition of Prudentius' Cathemerina‚
Leipzig, N. Faber, s.a. (see Ο. Gr. Schmidt's Mosellamus, 1867, p. 72); and who
was a friend of Eppendorff (N. Arch. s. sdchs. Gesch. xxiii, 1902, p. 142). He was
in office in 1515, but by 1523 his successor had been appointed. It does not
follow, however, that he was dead ; for the opening lines of this letter seem to
indicate that he was now retiring and settling in one of the Saxon university
towns, probably Leipzig, where he had matriculated in 1493, and was B.A. Sept.
1494, proceeding later M.A. His widow married Geo. Agricola (l. 1211) in 1543,
bore children to him in 1550 and 1552, and was still living in 1580: so that she
was perhaps Meyner’s second wife. See C. Meltzer, Historia Schneeberqensis‚ 1716,
i, p. 383 3 and a translation of Geo. Agricola's De re metallica, by H. C. and L. H.
Hoover, 1912, p. vii.

36. Regis nostri] Chai-les v. It
appears that since landing in the

the University, to which since 1503
Zasius had been legal adviser. For

Netherlands ho had conferred some
honour on Zasius, perhaps a renewal
of the councillorship which Maximilian
had bestowed in 1508 (Solu-eiber, Gesclz.
d. Univ. Freibury, i. 203).

37. Senex] Cf. Ep. 1103. 2411.

40. regentiae] The governing body of

several years now there had been con-
stant disputes with the Town Council
about dues and privileges. See Stint-
aing's Zasius, pp. 46, 243-4. On 5 Dec.
1520Ι the University decided to release
Zasius from some part of these duties ;
