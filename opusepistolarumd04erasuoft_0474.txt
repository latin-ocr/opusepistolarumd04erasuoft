426 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 520

J. Froben, July 1521, addressed to Pace from London, 5 June 1519, and renewing
a discussion on which Erasmus had already made a public pronouncement (Ep.
531. 408-14). After stating that he had first thought of collecting and publish-
ing Adayia ‘abhinc annos alterum et viginti ⁷—the first edition of his Prouerbia
appeared at Venice, Chr. de Pensis, 10 April 1498—Polydore goes on: ‘Post
aliquot annos . . . successorem habui nostrum Erasmum, id quod ob singularem
hominis doctrinam pergratum fuit: etsi ille ceu eiusmodi commentarioli nostri
minime sciens, vtrunque decus, inuentae scilicet rei atque auctae, ad se trahere
est conatus. Quem tamen vix potuit ignorare, si vnquam suum ipsius Adagiorum
opus Argentorati, quod est suae Germaniae oppidum, apud Matthiam Schurerium
formulis excusum vidit: vidit autem dubio procul, cum illud postmodum bis
terue adauxerit. Quippe in eius operis fronte Matthias attestatur se paulo ante
nostra Adagia in apertum protulisse (cf. l. 24n).

‘Ipsi etiam eum, cum aliquando apud nos pranderet (cf. l. 32), per iocum
nostri huius instituti aemulatorem appellauimus. Ita ille rei suae intentus
nuper in nouissima Paroemiarum suarum aeditione est palam professus primum
se apud Latinos id genus argumenti attentasse (Ep. 269. 58), vt cui tum non venit
in mentem nostri libelli imaginis Etenim pene incredibile est Erasmum tot
titulis redundantem velle cuiquam tam modicae inuentionis gloriolam inuidere.
Quanquam sunt nonnulli sagaciores qui adfirment eum idcirco illud dissimulasse,
vt qui praeter Adagiorum multitudinem nihilo plus praestiterat, ne videretur
esse imitatus, atque sic primas ferret partes. Ego tamen, quia veritas procul
eminet, totum istud aequi bonique faciens tantum apud te qui vtriusque nostrum
es ex aequo amantissimus, testatum esse volui, quo nihil ex eo offensionis posthac
essem habiturus.' It is surprising that a controversy which so easily admitted
of definite settlement, should have dragged on interminably. All that was
necessary was for the date of Polydore’s first edition to be advanced, and
Erasmus must have been completely silenced. But in 1530, and again in 1533,
he was still claiming priority: see Lond. xxvi. 63, LB. 1108, 4 April 1530, and
the pref-ace to the 1533 edition of his Adayc'a.

From internal evidence the date of this letter (1175) is not easy to determine ε
either 1519 or 1520 being possible. The reference to Lee at the beginning sug-

11 June (1521). Boniface after residence at Avignon from May 1520 to April
1521, on returning to Basle reports to Aleiati the books that he finds Froben has
in hand ε ⁴ Misit ad hunc Polydorus Vergilius sua Prouerbia ex literis Euangeli-
cis potissimum ancta? If, as indicated here (ll. 6—8, 114—18), Erasmus had
received from Froben Polydore’s preface and advised the publication in 1519,
Boniface would have known of the fact before going to Avignon, and would have
informed Alciati of it there. Corroboration may be obtained, too, from Ep. 1210.

The year-date given in F may be a mere misprint : or perhaps an example of
the rare method of dating by the incoming year after the Ides of December (see
Proctor 1, p. 16, ii, pp. 9, ιο). The year beginning at Christnms would not affect
the resent case.

Pdlydore Vergil (1470 ?—c. 1555), was educated at Padua and Bologna; and
studied at some time with Aleander (Al. Ε. 1. 34). Later he became a priest and
entered the service of the Duke of Urbino, his native town. His first publication
was a new edition of the Cornucopia of Nic. Perotti, Venice, Jo. de Tridino,
20 Dec. 1496: which he collated with a. manuscript 111 the Duke’s library. To
the Duke he dedicated a volume of Prouerbia (v. supra) 111 1498; and to a friend
De rerum iuuenioribus, Venice, Chr. de Pensis, 31 Aug. 1499-a markedly rational-
istic composition, which subsequently was placed upon the Index. In 1502
through the influence of his kinsman, Adrian dc Castello, bishop of Bath and
Wells, collector in England of Peter‘s Pence, Polydore was sent thither as
sub-collector. within a few years he acquired prebends at Heresord, Lincoln,
:md St. Paul's 3 and in 1508 the archdeaconry at Wells. In 1505, at the sugges-
11011 of chry vn he began to write a History of England‚ which was carried
down to 1509 in the first edition, Basle, J. Bebel, 1534, and to 1538 in the second.
Basle, M. Isingrin‚ 1555. The work was carried out on scientific lines, manu-
vscripts being consulted and oral tradition collected; and the first specimen of it
is to be seen in his edition of Gildas, which he dedicated to TunstalI, 6Apri1 1525.

His life in England was chequered. From May to December 1515 he was in
prison as the result of an attack upon Wolsey ; and in consequence he spent part
of 1516-17 in Italy. But he returned, and continued his life and work in
