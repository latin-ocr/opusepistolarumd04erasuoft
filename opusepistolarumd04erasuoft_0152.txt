108 LETTERS OF ERASMUs [1519

10351036 FRoM MARTm LYPsms,

Rotterdam MS„ Erasmus III. 102, p. 79. <Louvain.>
Horawitz v. 36. <October ‘? 1519.)

[The opening words suggest that these letters were exchanged not long after
Nesen's arrival at Louvain in July 1519 (Ep. 994. 911). Τ110 person and the
business alluded to can only be conjectured: possibly Dorp and the letter from
the theologICal society in Paris (cf. Epp. 994, 1002, 1024), or one of the Univer-
sity officials and the trouble about Nesen's lectures (Ep. 1046 introd.>. In the
former case the date would be about the end of July, in the latter perhaps
october.]

1037. FROM EDWARD LEE.

Annotationes Leei‚ Paris <1520>‚ f0. a v0 (a). <Louvain.>
Annotationes Leei‚ Basle, 1520, p. 3 (β). <October ἱ) 1519.)

[The preface to Lee's Annotatz‘ones in Annotateones Noui Testamenti Desideria· Erasmi,
Paris, <Conr. Reseh), s.a. (α). Prefixed to the book is a letter of Lee to the
students ofLouva1n, 29 Dec. (1519), which forms the first item on the title-
page, Apologia Edouardi Lee& contra quorundam calumnias3 and at the end of all
comes Lee's letter to Erasmus (Ep. 1061) of 1 Feb. 1520. The letter to Louvain
is on four sheets signed AA—Dn. The Annoeationes begin on sheet a, and the letter
to Erasmus follows, beginning 011 f0. K4. This arrangement shows that the
Αηηοίαείοηεε, which are the substantive part of the volume, with this preface on
the verso of the title, were printed first, ending on 11³, with Κ* perhaps blank3
that then the letter to Louvain was added on new signatures 3 and that finally
Ep. 1061, or at. least the later part of it, was appended. The printing was
executed by Gilles Gourmont (cf. Ep. 1074. 87) for Com-ad Resch of Basle (cf.
Epp. 1061. 50511, 1083. 1-3), the connexion with Basle being shown by an
ornamenta] berder on the title-page to the ,ainnoiationes (f0. a) hearing the

1035. 4. te‹·um egerit] Perhaps cf. Ep. 1024. 3.
