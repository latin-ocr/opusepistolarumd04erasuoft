1044] FROM MARTIN DORP 125

mouthpiece (Epp. 304, 337. 37311, 347‘, he had had a reconciliation with Erasmus
(Ep. 438) and then again a rupture (Ep. 474. 17n). But the 111-03011 had been
healed again (cf. Epp. 627. 16, 852. 946, and BRE. 121); and now, reacting
towards humanistie studies, and yielding perhaps to externa] pressure (cf. Epp.
994. 13-15, 1002. 33—9), he had recently printed his Oration (l. 1611), in evidence
of his changed point of view, and for a time was even inclined to take an
interest in Luther (cf. Ζνν.2 Ε. 124y LE.² 291). From this he retired laten but
his sympathy with humanism remained unimpaired. and parted him from his
former auios. See de Jongh, pp. 162—5‚ 45*--46*; and cf. Acta Acad. Louanien.
contra Lmtlcerum.

The purpose of his present visit 10 1110 Hague is not known. He had just
resigned 1110 Presidency of the College du Saint Esprit at Louvain, perhaps not
altogether willi1igly(see l. 16n), and had been succeeded byRuard Tapper, 21 Nov.
(de Jongh. pp. 181. 44*). It seems from l. 81 that he was on business and was not
quite his own master. It is evident, however, from de Jongh‚ p. 46³³, that his

sevsxssnce from Louvain was only tempor-ary3 cf. Epp. 1103. 25—6‚ 1165. 26-7‚
an E. 11.

This letter is the last that survives of his correspondence with Erasm11s; but
their friendship now renewed (cf. 1. 4911) lasted till Dorp's death in 1525]

MARTINVS DORPIVS CLARISSIMO DOMINO ERASMO ROTERODAMO
SALVTEM Ι). P.
MmoR vehementer, eruditissime domine, quid acciderit istis vt ita

sursum ac deorsum omnia versent. vt eximios aliquot sic de studiis,
sic de re Christiana meritos male vexent. Polliceor tibi et Domino

,Ι Deo, me non habebunt turbae istius consortem. Quanto Christianius

est recte omnia ac sane intelligere et in meliorem partem interpretari! 5

Sec-us qui faciunt, nonne ipsi malum inferunt doctorum virorum
lucubrationibus? Queso te per gloriam Christi, mi Erasme, omnis
eruditionis princeps, vt ne animo frangaris ob quorundam et paucorum
et inermium ineptissimam simul et stultissimam importunitatem.
Magis te consolentur tot eximiorum tum principum tum episcoporum.
tot eruditissimorum toto orbe virorum amicissima de te tuaque
eruditione iuditia, eaque quum verissima tum constantissima.

Hic certe ita ex animo fauent tibi, ita admirantur, ita predicant
operatua insignia, vt non credam simile contigisse cuiquam mortalium
omnibus retro seculis, ne Hyeronymo quidem ipsi. Non fingo 1100,
teste Deo, mi Erasme. Omnes eruditi gratulantur mihi de Orationis
meae editione, quod animum sententiamque meam ingenue testatus
sim sine vllo fuco. Magnificus idemque eruditissimus iurisconsultus

delivered in 1516, but had only
recently been printed, Antwerp,
M. Hillen, 27 Sept. 1519, with a preface
to Beatus Rhenanus (ΒΕΕ. 126). Dorp
no doubt sent it to Basle, for Froben
reprinted itin Jan. 1520 (cf. BRE. 143 ;
Zw. ΕΡ 118) : but it appears (ll. 56-8)
that he had not yet received any
intimation of Froben's intention, and
so appealed for Erasmus’ intervention.

As a result, Froben produced a later
issue of the same edition, March 1520.
with this letter appended: to Dorp's
regret (BRE. 166)—for‚ in spite of the
discreet omission at l. 40, the publi-
cation was sure to increase liis difficul-
ties at Louvain3 cf. a letter of Jvrome
Froben, 7 Feb. 1520 (Zw.E.² 1 18), report-
ing that Dorp had been ‘a factione
theologica summa ob orationem editam
affectus contumelia, simulque ex suo
eiectus collegio, ac nunc totus agit Eras-
micum '. See, however, Ep. 1 165. 26-7.
