LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1521

Et imminet Patris facies dicentis ‘Ipsum audite’: nam
In postremo sacellum est, in quo
Tota schola nullos habet angulos aut

secessus, adeo vt nec solarium sit vllum aut cubiculum. Pueris
singulis suus est locus in gradibus paulatim ascendentibus, distinctis

spaciis.

Quaeque classis habet sedecim, et qui in sua classe prae-

cellit, sellulam habet caeteris paululo eminentiorem. Nec quosuis
admittunt temere, sed delectus fit indolis et ingeniorum.
Vidit hoc vir perspicacissimus, in hoc esse praecipuam reipublicae

spem, si prima aetas bonis rationibus institueretur.

Ea res cum

constet immensa pecunia, tamen nullum in huius consortium admi-

Britannicae.

Quidam legarat in eam structuram centum libras monetae
Vbi sensit Coletus hac gratia sibi nescio quid iuris

365 vindicare laicos, permissu Episcopi sui eam pecuniam contulit in

370

sacras vestes templi.

Reditibus totique negocio praefecit non sacer-

dotes, non episcopum aut capitulum, vt vocant, non magnates; sed

ciues aliquot coniugatos probatae famae.

Roganti causam ait nihil

quidem esse certi in rebus humanis, sed tamen in his se minimum

inuenire corruptelae.

Atque vt hoc opus nemo non probauit, ita multi demirabantur

355. solarium F: coenaculum H.

352. Ipsum audite] Cf. Matt. 17. 5.
Luke 9. 35, 2 Pet. 1. 17.

355. solarium] This term is com-
monly used in English of an upper
chamber, as towards the sun3 but- it
sometimes denotes a room cut off from
the great hall and giving privacy. The
change in H was perhaps made by
Erasmus because the classical and
Vulgate (Off.) usage of the word is
different, for a flat house-top or bal-
cony; which would be inappropriate
here.

362. immensa pecunia] Cf. Ep. 260.
20-30. ,

365. Episcopi] Richard Fitzjames
(c. 1440—15 Jan. 1522), a native of
Bruton in Somerset. In 1465 he was
electedFellowofMertonCollege‚0xford;
of which he was afterwards Warden,
1483-1507. Ηο was vice-Chaucellor
of Oxford University 1481, and Chan-
cellor 1502. After serving as chaplain
to Edward Π and almoner to Henry vn,
1495, he was appointed bp. of Rochester
1497, and in 1499 went as ambassador
to Flanders. He was translated to
Chichester 1504, and again to London
1506; where he rebuilt Fulham Palace.
At Merton he ornamented the chapel
and enlarged the Warden's lodgings‚
and presented 20 mss. to the libi-ary
(H. Ο. Coxe, catalogus), two of which
are now in the Bodleian. He is de-
picted here (11. 530-1, as a strongly

conservative theologian3 but one ofthe
mss. mentioned is of the Homilies of
Origen, whowvas then regarded as
dangerously heretica] (cf. ll. 24-9);
others are of Seneca, Jerome and
Augustine, isidore, Galen in Latin,
and Lully. An Easter sermon in
English preached by him was printed
by VVynkyn de Worde, c. 1495. With
his brother he was joint-founder of
Bruton School, 15193 see Notes and
Queries soi⁴ Somerset ancl Dor-set, iii
(1892-31, pp. 241—8. Bk. 17 of Bern.
Andreas’ notes on Augustine, De ciui·
tate Dei (Ep. 243. 5211) is dedicated to
him.

See DNB. and B. W. Henderson‚
Mei-ton Oolleye. The estimate of his age
in l. 539 is perhaps as vague as that for
More’s father in Ep. 1233. 162.

365. contulit] In his Eapositio literalis
on Romans, ed. Lupton, with the Letters
to Radulphus, 1876, pp. 112, 245, Colet
enunciates the principle of interference
with unsatisfactory bequests : ‘Quando
vero (testamentum) non congruit
voluntati Dei, nec habet pietatem, nec
olet charitatem, nec fructum aliquem
in gracia, sed dispendium secundum
humanum affectum, tunc id dirumpi
et potest et debet ².

366. praefecit] Erasmus discusses
Colet’s principle in this matter at
length in the De pronuntiatione (LB. i.
918 r-19 A).
