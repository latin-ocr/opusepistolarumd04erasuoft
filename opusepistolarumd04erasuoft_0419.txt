precaution they were printed at once, s. Lea α. (cf. SE. 223), though to Luther‘s
annoyance (LE.‘·‘ 400. 32-8)‚ together with some other items on the sarne subject.
They are also included in the collected editions of Luther's works from 1545
onwards.

Short accounts of Erasmus’ interview with Duke Frederic are given in the fifth
book of Carion's Chronicle, as edit-ed by Caspai· Peucer, Melanchthon’s son-in-
law, first printed at Frankfort, 1566 ; and in M. Dresserus’ Isayoye Historica, 1601,
p. 523. When they first appeared, they held the field ; but now that Spalatinus’
records are accessiblc‚ the value of these less authentic narratives is slight.

At the ceremonies which accompanied the coronation, Erasmus doubtless met
numerous old friends and patrons3 but he does not mention many by name.
Meander, whom lie had cause to distrust (see p. 112), and whom he had not
visited at Antwerp and Louvain in Sept.-Oct. (pp. 351, 353), he now with some
difficulty found at Cologne. For sear of poison he would not accept any hos-
pitality (Ep. 1188. 31-7‘, 3 but they had an interview of five 01· six hours. The
grievances that each had against the other were freely rehearsed 3 and Aleander
charged Erasmus with denying the genuineness of the Bull against Luther. But
at the end they parted with the kiss of ancient friendship (Spongia, LB. x. 1645
cn -- HE. 333, §§ 131,2 ε cf. Balan no. 36, which indicates 9 Nov. as the date).
Aleander invited him to Rome, and the offer of a bishopric (cf. Ep. 1141. 3011)
was also perhaps renewed on this occasion. For other fragments of their con·
versation see Resp. ad Α. Pium (LB. ix. 1099 Gn, 1104 c, 1105 1), 1118 AB, 1119 Β).
Faber (p. 357] and Brassicanus he saw again (BRE. 189⁸), to Capito he gave advic‹¹
on behalf of Luther <LE.² 474. 8⁴14) ; and among the new acquaintances whom
he made were Hieroslaus Lasky (Ep. 124211), Rudbert of Mosham, who was in the
train of Matt. Lang, abp. of Salzburg <Epp. 1450, 1512 3 Heumann pp. 2655), and
Francis of Sickingen (Ep. 1166. 721¹)· But Hutten, Sickingen's confederate, was
not there (Ep. 1166. 108-10}.

ERASMVS ROTEROD. CLARISS. D. IOANNI REVCHLINO S. D.

Rssvmmn. D. Cardinalis Sedunensis, cum nuper apud eum
pranderem, narrabat te vita defunctum esse. Mihi non libebat
credere, quia non erat e re literarum verum esse. At mox letiora
nunciarunt alii3 quae praecor vt nobis sint perpetua, vir optime
idemque doctissime. Vides fatalem esse tragoediam quae nunc
agitur3 cuius qualis sit futura catastrophe incertum. Qualis qualis
est futura, precor vt cedat in gloriam Christi et in rem Euangelicae
veritatis. Ego huius fabulae spectator esse malim quam histri03
non quod recusem ob Christi negocium aliquod subire discrimen, sed
quod perspiciam negocium esse supra meam exiguitatem. Vtinam
tam possem praestare quod est optimum, quam opto! Non dubito
quin tibi adsint graues et amici consolatores, qui tibi omnem aegri-
tudinem adimant, si quam animo concepisti, vt inea consolatione non
sit opus. Altius infixus es animis bonorum virorum quam vt hinc
vllis Iacobitarum obtrectationibus queas reuelli. Res est inuicta
veritas. Et tacita bonorum iudicia perpetuam obtinent autoritatem,
etiam apud posteros suum habitura pondus.
