[This letter comes between the death of Cardinal Croy (1. 55) and the publica—
tion of F. It may be placed here because of the verbal resemblance in ll. 30-1 to
Ep. 1192. 5-6. The figure of Scylla and Charybdis is found in Epp. 1186, 1195,
1205, 1216, 1228.

Louis of Flanders, seigneur of Praet († 7 Oct. 1555), soldier, administrator, and
diplomat, was one of the foremost figures in the Netherlands during the reign of

the boy to be brought up, like Badius, in the school of the Brethren ot' the
Common Life at Ghent3 see Badius' preface to Vergil‘s Aeneis, Paris, 1 Feb.
1503, dedicated to him. After studying 31 Louvain (cf. l. 1311) Louis took part

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS S. D.

Vm non vno decorum genere clarissime, cum Antonius Claua
frequenter ad me scribat, nec vllo in argumento illum destituat
mirabilis 1113 Suadela, quam illi natura insitam auxit vsus et eru-
ditio, tamen nullam causam egit vnquam vel ardentius vel copiosius
quam proximis literis3 mecum maiorem in modum expostulans,
quod immemor veteris promissi nihil adhuc scripserim celsitudini
tuae sic de me meritae cotidieque merenti. Facit ille quidem amice
quod extimulat ad scribendum—tametsi nihil opus erat stimulo, si
per immensos studiorum labores liceret hac in parte vel animo meo
vel amicorum votis ac meritis 1·espondere—— ; sed amicius erat factu-
rus si argumentum etiam epistolae suppeditasset. Animum istum
