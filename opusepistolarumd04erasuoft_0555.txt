1210] TO RICHARD PACE 507

Verum illud, mi Pacaee, me male cruciat, quod de commentariis
Romae relictis nihil audio. Quaeso ne quid te sumptus moueat quo
minus huc referantur. Non fiet tuo dispendio ; reddetur impendium
vel ad assem. Si redeat modo secundus liber Antibarbarorum,

caeterorum iacturam facile patiar. Bene vale.

[This biographical sketch of Colet was projected by Erasmus immediately
after his friend‘s death (Epp. 1026. 2-4, 1027. 8-9, 1030. 46-8), as not long since
he had composed a similar sketch of More (Ep. 999). In executing it he
enriched the picture by portraying another friend (see Ep. 163. 3n) whose
character had much in common with Colet's. For some reason the work did
not progress rapidly, perhaps because the information he had asked sor from
his English correspondents was not forthcoming gcf. Ep. 1229. 3-5): certainly
it appears that the details given are drawn from what 110 might have known by
personal experience. It may be noted that, like Ep. 999, this is addressed not
to one of Colet‘s own countrymen, but to a German: perhaps in this case with
special purpose (cf. Ep. 876 introd.).

An evidence of the interest evoked by this sketch may be found in a letter of
Martin Tyndall‚ a young Cambridge scholar, to Thomas Cromwell, 2 July 1533
(Brewer vi. 751, 752 ε the original being at the Record office, and a rough-draft
in the British Museum, Harl. MS. 6989, f. 45). Being driven away from King’s
College by the plague, Tyndall came to London 3 and there, to employ his time,
visited the booksellers in St. Paul’s churchyard. In one of the shops 110 found
a copy of what he calls Farra90 Epistozarum Erasmicarum‚ a ⁶ boke off the worste
printe'. but which must have been F (cf. Ep. 1206 introd.)‚ or even H; for
there ‘buried in a strange [s]tonge‚ in corner off greate boke’, lay this letter.
It delighted him so much that he borrowed the volume for a week and made
a translation ; which he sent to Cromwell written in a ‘course hande', being
unable to afford the six or seven shillings which it would have eost to get it
copied out fair.

hndall's translation is not known to survive. The earliest extant version,
of the life of Colet only, but amplified with material from other sources, is one
by Dr. Thomas Smith‚ Cambridge, 1661 ; which was reprinted in a miscellany
entitled The Pheniz, vol. ii, 1708, and subsequently by Chr. Wordsworth in the
successive editions of his Ecclesiastical Bioyraphz‘es. A complete translation was
made by the late Mr. J. H. Lupton, Lond0u, 1883, with elaborate notes, to
which I have been continually indebted—far more often, indeed, than Ι have

been able to acknowledge.

The misprint in the year-date as given in H has caused this letter to be
wrongly dated by almost all writers who have made use of it. From the fact of
Erasmus' residence at Anderlecht, combined with the mention in Ep. 1229,
there can be no doubt that 1521 is correct. 'l'he number of blunders in the text

of F, which had to be set right in the corrigenda, is notIceable.]
