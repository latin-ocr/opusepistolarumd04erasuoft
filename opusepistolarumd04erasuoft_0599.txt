1222. FROM JOHN Lou1s VIVES.

Viuis Opera, 1555, ii, p. 960 (a). Bruges.
Vi. Ε., f. 54 (β); Lond. Viv. 6 (=5): LB. 585. 10 July 1521.

[This letter and many others from Vives which follow (Epp. 1256, 1271,
1281, 1303, 1306, 1362 διο.) come from the first collected edition of Vives' works ;
which was published at Basle by Nic. Episcopius the younger, Aug. 1555, in
two volumes (a). The originals were no doubt the actual letters received by
Erasmus, and probably formed part of the great manuscript collections preserved
by Bonifaee Amerbach ; but they are not now to be found, having perhaps been
allowed to perish when once they had been printed. They were not carefully
edited ; and consequently a number of obvious errors have made their way into
the text. ι

In the following year this series was appended to another collection of Vives'
letters (Vi. R), printed from his rough drafts, which had come into the hands
of the printer G. Simon, Antwerp, 1556 (β). Simon's text of this part is a mere
reprint of the Basle volume, with a few corrections and some depravations. The
London editors, also printing from a, did more harm than good to the text 3 but
Leclerc improved it notably, though admitting some of the London corruptions
—a coincidence in error which shows evidently that he was using Lond. to
print from. It is noticeable, too, that in dealing with the difficulty in 1. 40 he
quotes the London edition, but no other.

The year-dates of these letters of 1521—2 are confirmed by the frequent refer-
ences to Vives’ edition of Augustine, Ciu. Dei, sor which Erasmus wrote a preface
(Ep. 1309), and which Froben finished printing in Sept. 1522. The series of
Erasmus’ letters, written from Basle, would have completed and elucidated
the correspondence ; but they have disappeurcd. By 1529, when Erasmus
