1018. To FLORENCE or EGMONT.

[The reference to Ferdinand (l. 16) implies that the question of his education
was still recent ; so that the date given in the text may be accepted.

Florence of Egmont was 3 patron with whom Erasmus had had relations
during his early residence at Louvain (cf. Ep. 178. 44n). His only son, Maxi—
milian of Egmont († 23-4 Dec. 1548), had been a student at Louvain since 1516 ;
for in a preface, dated 20 April (1519), to the first edition of Adr. Barland's De
Hollandz'ae principibus, Antwerp, J. 'thil-mult, July 1519, 110 and his kinsmen,
George and Philip of Egmont, to whom the dedication is jointly made, are said
to have been attending Barland's lecturos for nearly three years. The question
of providing a new teacher for him seems now to have arisen3 Arnold (1. 10)
being probably a tutor who lived with the boy but took no part in his studies.
As in an earlier case (Ep. 737), Erasmus declined the post for himself, but sug-
gested a friend as a substitute3 cf. also Ep. 1208. In 1521 the boy was still at
Louvain, and learning Homer by heart for ‘repetition ' (Ep. 1192. 81—2).

Maximilian became as mighty a warrior as his father, whom he succeeded in
the lordship of Ysselstein, sw. of Utrecht, and the county of Buren in sw. Guel-
dres, and, like whom, he was in 1540 Stadhouder of Friesland. In Oct. 1540 he
was created a Knight of the Golden Fleece by Charles' nomination (de Reiffen·
berg, p. 394). His most famous exploit was his march from the Netherlands
through Protestant Ger-many to relieve Charles at Ingolstadt in 1546. The story
of his ceremonious death is told in BN. vi. 488—90. His only daughter became
the first wife of William the silent. See P. Kannengiesser, Καὶ-Ζ ὐ mzd Maximiliau
Eqmont, Graf von Βίίνεη, 1895.]

ERAsMVS ROTERODAMVS CLARISS. PRINCIPI ISELSTEYNO

CLAnrssmn: princePS, munus quod tua benignitas nobis donauit, non
vno nomine mihi fuit gratissimum 3 vel quod a tali profectum heroe vel
quod vltro delatum, nec promerito nec expectanti. Admonui filium
tuae celsitudinis, rarae cuiusdam indolis puerum, vt mihi in referenda
gratia sit auxilio. Sic enim videbor retulisse, si effecero vt ille in
bonis literis expectationi tuae respondeat. Recepit facturum, ac mihi
sane in hac aetatula iam nunc emicans eruditionis specimen maximam
spem praebet talem euasurum Maximilianum, vt non solum suo
generi verum etiam ipsis literis bonis sit olim ornamento futurus.
Arnoldus vt est pueri amantissimus ita eum non minus diligenter 10
quam blande curat.
