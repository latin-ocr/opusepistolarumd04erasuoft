606 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1521

1246. FROM VVILLIAM TA'rE.

Brcslau MS. Rehd. 254. 149. Richmond.
ΕΕ ². 6. 4 December 1521.

[An origiiial letter actually sent and seemiugly autograph3 but with the
address-sheet missing. The dates are sufficiently confirmed by the mention of
Henry's book (l. 26: see Ep. 1227. 511) and the Bull that followed (l. 2111).

W. Tate of York (†c. 10 Sept. 1540] met Erasmus in 1499 or 1505—6 in England
and in 1500 οι· 1506 t Ep. 535. 39—425 at Orleans (l. 2) : where he no doubt obtained
his degree in law. In 1512 he was a trustee to whom certain lands in Yorkshire
were demised (Brewer i. 3386). Later he secured a position at Court ι whence in
Dec. 1517 he was sent to carry the King's christinus offering to Canterbury. and
in 1521 the Assertio to Rome (ibid. ii, p. 1476, iii. 1450] ; and the present letter
evidently was written from the royal palace (Ep. 937. 4611). In 1520 he was
treasurer of Beverley Minster, where his name is cai-ved on 0110 of the stalls
(G. Oliver, Bererley, 1829, p. 330). In 1522 he received a canonry at Windsor and
a prebend at York (Le Neve iii. 392, 176)—preferment which perhaps indicates
that 110 was already attached to the household of Henry vni’s natural son, the
Duke of Richmond (1519—36). By 1525 he was a member of the Duke's Council
in the North. at a time when the hoy was thought likely to be the heir to the
throne (DNB. xix. 204]; and in 1526 he was his almoner (Brewer iv). The
date of his death may be approximately inferred; for his will was made 011
9 Sept. 1540. and the rectory of Chelmsford which 110 held, was filled up on
11 Sept. 3 see Kotes and Queries, 5th ser.v x. 55, and cf. Ep. 623 introd. To his
prebends appointments were made on 7 and 8 Oct. 1540 (Brewer xvi. 220. 13,
and Le Neve iii. 393, 176).

He is very likely the ‘humanissimus Dr. Taitus⁷, whom Wakefeld (Ep. 1311.
4411) mentions as a friend and praises for his knowledge of Hebrew (Oratio,
ff. 0⁸, Ε2 v⁰): but though he had learning enough to quote Greek here, the
Latinity of this letter leaves something to be desired.]

INTER LL. DOCTORES MINIMVS S. P. D.

IAM ad te scribere, vir doctissime, (impellit) non modo vetus illa
inter nos amicitia olim et Britanniae hic concoepta, Aureliaeque, Gal-
liarum vrbe, continuata, verumetiam quod indies magis ac magis
philosophiam, illam scilicet Christi, sapere nitentibus viam ipsam,
nedum semitam latissimam, demonstras. quue quantum emolu-
menti-in Christo militantibus es allaturus, mihi haud facile putem
dictu. Aeuo proculdubio illo natus es foelici, ac me quidem, quod
aeuo tuo superstes sim, ingenti afficIOr gaudio. Vehementius tamen
gauderem, si illa locorum inter nos distantia <ad>mitteret‚ quo
inpraesentiarum consuetudinem apud me tui interdum haberem.
Animo penitus istic apud te moror, quanquam corpus illud meum
inter nonnullos 1110 inuidia latrantes bonosque semper et eruditos
lacerantes viros tedio non mediocri afficiatur. Caeterum quum ii
linguis alios feriant, sese dilaniant. Hinc τοῦ τὸ ἀπόφθεγμα σοφοῦ,
Τὰ ’γὰρ τοῦ φθόνου κινήματα αὐτοῦ πληγαὶ ’γίνονται τοῦ βασκάνου. Sed

7. foelici] This may be contrasted with Erasmus* own view of himself:
