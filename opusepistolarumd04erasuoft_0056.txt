18 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

nibus aliisque consimilibus progymnasmatis sacerdotium meditans.
Qua quidem 111 1-0 11011 paulo plus ille sapiebat quam plerique isti qui
temere ad tam arduam professionem ingerunt sese, nullo prius sui
periculo facto. Neque quicquam obstabat quo minus sese huic vitae
generi addiceret, nisi quod vxoris desyderium non posset excutere.
Maluit igitur maritus esse castus quam sacerdos impurus.

Tamen virginem duxit admodum puellam claro genere natam,
rudem adhuc, vtpote ruri inter parentes ac sorores semper habitam,
quo magis 1111 liceret illam ad suos mores fingere. Hanc et literis
instituendam curauit et omni musices genere doctam reddidit;
planeque talem pene finxerat quicum lubuisset vniuersam aetatem
exigere, ni mors praematura puellam sustulisset e medio, sed enixam

out (ΕΗΒ. vii. 713,14) that it was

probably during this period that More
made the acquaintance of John Bonge,
Bownge, or Bunge, a contemporary of
,John Fisher at Cambridge, where they
had been ι50011015 togethyr ’, also B.A.
and M.A. ‘bothe off on day ⁷ ε the latter
degree in 1490, see Cambridye (ἔναυε Boolss
Α. 214, Β, 1. 26. Bonge became More's
confessor, ‘christened two of his chil-
dren, buried his first wife and married
him to his second '.

164. sui periculo] A point on which
Erasmus always lays great stress: cf.
11- 67-71‚ Epp· 296- 34-6‚ 447· 138⁷ 194,
858. 495, 1158. 4—5, 1202. 220.

168. Tamen] This unexpected con-
junction suggests that the three pre-
vious sentences (which are a character-
istic Erasmian sally) were added later
than the first composition.

puellam] Jane Colt (c. 1487-
1511 ε cf. Ep. 221. 3111), eldest
daughter of John Colt of Netherhall,
near Roydon in Essex (see Ep. 829.
27n). Her marriage with More cannot
be dated later than c. J an. 1505. From
the initial similarity of language she
may be identified with the young wife
from the country, married at 17, who
at first found her husband’s instruction
irksome, but was brought by her father
to happy compliance ; as described in
the colloquy onr μεμψὶγαμος, first
printed in Aug. 1523 (LB. i. 704 n-5 0).
See The Times, Lit. Suppl., 26 Dec. 1918.
Α story of More’s deceiving her with
sham jewels is told in the Moria (LB.
iv. 451 cn).

169. sorores] For these see Ph.M0rant‚
Hist. ffEssex, 1768, ii. 492.

174. tres] In writing quatuor in E,
Erasmus was doubtless thinking of
the adopted daughter, Margaret Giggs

(1508-6 July 1570), whom he mentions
in this connexion in Ep. 1233. 57,
and whom More regarded as one of
his own. About 1530 she married with
John Clement (Ep. 388. 173n).

174. Margareta] (0. Oct. 1505-1544),
More’s eldest and favourite daughter.
By Sept. 1521 (Ep. 1233. 53—43 cf. l.
13311) 5110 was married to william Roper
(1496-1578), a member of a Kentish
family living at Well Hau, near Eltham
(cf. Ep. 104 introd.) ; but was still
dwelling, with her husband, in her
father’s house. At Christmas 1523
Erasmus dedicated to her some hymns
of Prudentius, with a preface which
carries congratulations on the birth of
their first child. He wrote to her
again in 1529 (Lond. xxvi. 50, LB.
1075) ; and her autograph reply is still
extant (Breslau MS. Rehd. 254. 129:
LB. App. 352). Some of her father’s
letters to her are printed by Stapleton,
Tres leomae, 1588, in Latin, and are re—
produced in English by 01053010 More.
John Coster (see Ep. 75ointrod.) in edit·
ing Vincentius Lirinensis’ Pro cambucae
fidei antiquitate, Paris, M. Julianus, 1569,
cites (f. 47 z from information received
from John Clement) an emendation by
her in Cyprian's Ep. 30. 3, 'nemos for nisi
vos: which is the reading of Erasmus'
editions. Mr. A. W. Reed has shown
(Trans. os the Biblioqrapkz'cal Soc„ N. Β. 11)
that she translated Erasmus' Precatio
Dominica into English, in an edition
printed by T. Ber-thelet before 12 March
152}- No copy is known: but it was
110 doubt the same translation which

W. de Worde printed, London, (c. ᾗ
1 Oct.) 1524. She is credited also by

Stapleton, op. cit„ pp. 238, 242-3, with
a treatise De quatuor nouissimis and with

some declamations in imitation of χ
