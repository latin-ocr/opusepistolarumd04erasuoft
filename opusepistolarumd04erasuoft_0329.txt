1111] TO ζῘΟΗΝ LOUIs VIVEs 283

licet harena cedere, nec vllus est pugnarum finis. Nulla me res
inuitauit vt Louanium commigrarem nisi coelum salubrius et locus
amoenior 3 et ad rixas inexplicabiles mihi videor venisse.

Budaeum quem tu meritissimo magnificis laudibus vehis, soleo 80
nonnunquam et apud Germanos meos ad inuidiam vsque iactare: qui
cum negare non possent eum esse summum in omni literarum genere.
solent causificari summum quidem esse sed vnum. ‘Atqui hoc’
inquam ‘nomine Gallia vincit nostram Germaniam, quae nullum
habet Budaeo parem, tametsi permultos habet mediocres, nonnullos 85
supra mediocritatem '. Velitationis illius qua conflictati sumus, iam-
pridem oblitus sum, tantum abest vt commouear. Et erga Fabrum
eo sum animo vt ingrata mihi narret, qui secus de illo praedicat
quam dignum est integerrimo doctissimoque viro.

R. card. Croium quum aliis multis de causis mihi charissimum, 90
hoc etiam nomine amo, quod et te nobis restituerit et a cruditatis
periculo subduxerit. Bene vale, Lodouice doctissime, et cura vt te
quam primum hic hilarem ac lubentem videamus.

Louanii. [Anno M.1).xxr].

1112. To THOMAS WOLSEY.

Paraphr. in Epist. Petri et Iudae, f0. a2. Louvain.
Lond. xxix. 76: LB. vii. 1079. (c. June 1520.)

[The preface to the Paraphrases 011 the Epistles of St. Peter and st. ‚J ude.
The first edition is doubtless that of Martem, Louvain‚ s. α. (α) : a rare volume
of which there are copies in the Bibl. Nationale at Paris (A. 18182. 5) and the
University Library at Ghent (Res. 155). This prefaee was reprinted by Froben
in an edition of Jan. 1521 without change except for some negligible misprints.
of the Subsequent Froben editions (see Ep. 710 introd.) the octavo of March 1521
(β) has an insertion which can only have been made by Erasmus himself. In
July 1521 (γ) there is a necessary correction ; in the octavo of 1523 (δ) 3 corruption
which the later texts followed. But apart from these changes the only consider·
able revision is, as in Ep. 916, in the folio of 1532 (ε). There are some slight
variations‚ no doubt unintentional, in the posthumous volumes of 1540 (3²¹) and
1541 (ff -

Erasnlus had begun these Paraphrases in May (Ep. 1102. 19-20); but while
engaged with them, he fell seriously ill. He had probably designed to finish
the book for presentation to Wolsey at Calais (see p. 296), in fulfilment of the
promise made in February (Ep. 1060. 57). So he worked 011, dictating to
a secretary3 and thus completed what was lacking, the Paraphrase on Jude
and this preface (Epp. 1116, 1117). Martens no doubt did his part punctually;
but Wolsey was too busy to receive the book at Calais, and Erasmus was obliged
to send it later (Ep. 1132). For his illness at this time cf. also Epp. 1111. 1,
1113-15, 1117.16-17‚ 126.

The omission of dates in this preface and the book itself was probably in-
tentional, in case the presentation should be delayed 3 cf. 1. 211 and Ep. 284 introd.
An approximate date can be assigned for this preface from Ep. 1117. 125-6 ]
