[Written just before Ep. 1243.

For Erasmus’ journey from Louvain to Basle see Epp. 1302, 1342. The last
date on which he can be traced at Anderlecht is 14 Oct. (Ep. 1239). He then
went to Louvain for six dayffOEp. 1342. 102), stayed in the Wild Man inn
(Ep. 1244. 311) and had more amicable intercourse with Aleander than shortly
before at Brussels (see p. 591). For some days he was at Antwerp collecting
money from his pension (Epp. 1302. 23—24‚ 1342. 101—2) ; and dined with Gilles
in company with Nicholas of Hertogenbosch (Ep. 1697). Then he returned to
Louvain, and set out for Basle on the asternoon of 28, Oct. (Epp. 1342. 113,
133—4‚ 145—6). The first night seems to have been spent at Tirlemont. where he
picked up a troop of disbanded soldiers who were returning up the Rhine (Epp.
1302. 14-15, 1342. 148-54). For the next stages their route no doubt followed
his line in Sept. 1518 (Ep. 867), to St. Trond, Tongres, Maastricht‚ and Aachen.
Thence they went to Duren ; but instead of entering Cologne, they rode straight
to the Rhine‚ through a place which he calls ‘Sychimum ³, perhaps Sechtem‚
SE. of Bruhl. From Coblenz on, he went by the right bank of 'the Rhine, to have
the escort of the soldiers: but at Spires he left them and crossed back again,
finally making his way to Basle through Strasburg, soblem-taut, and Colmar.
In a letter to Alciati (Basle MS. C. V12. 73. 163) Boniface Amerbach announces
that he arrived at Basle on 15 Nov. 3 cf. ZE. 33.

So long as he was with the soldiers‚ he travelled very rapidly, partly no doubt
from his desire to keep up with them, and partly because he was eager to finish
his journey and get on with his work. After such fatigues he rested two days
at Spires and two at Strasb11rg‚in each case perhaps two full days and three
nights. The last three stages apparently each occupied a day. In this course
the only fixed points are those of his setting-forth and arrival, 28 Oct. and 15 Nov.
Some guidance as to time may be obtained from his journey of Sept. 1518 (Ep.
867); but in the absence of more precise information the following itinerary
can only be conjectural ε

28 Oct. From Louvain to Tirlemont.

29 Oct-2 NoV. From Tirlemont to Duren.
