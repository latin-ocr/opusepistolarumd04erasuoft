LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1520

20 demia, iam olim celebris ac solennibus illis studiis florens, nunc
politioris literaturae ac linguarum accessione per te sic est ornata vt

vix vlli caeterarum cedat.

Tua benignitas excitauit atque euexit in-

genium Petri Mosellam, iuuenis magnae iam eruditionis sed spei

longe maximae.

Eadem Henricum Stromerum, virum integritate

25 summa singularique prudentia iam pridem spectatum, allexit 111
istam vrbem, vt et scholae decus esset eximie doctus medicus, et

30

ciuitatis senator grauissimus.

Eadem Simonem Pistorium‚ ordina-

rium iuris professorem, ornat ac fouet3 eadem Georgium a Brey-
tenbach‚ virum non minus clarum iuris professione quam generis

imaginibus.

Atque optimi Principis exemplum imitatur senatus

pene vniuersus cum magistratibus caeteris, optimis studiis ac virtuti-
bus honorem modis omnibus habens : quos omnes tam procul semo-
tos a nobis, tamen ex amicorum literis publicaeque famae praeconio

cognoui.

27. Pistorium] Simon Pistorius (28
Oct. 1489—3 Dec. 1562) or Pistoris
(probably Becker: cf. LE.2 3332) was
the son of a noted Leipzig physician.
After proceeding B.A. at Leipzig 111
1505, LL.B. 1509—10, with an interval
at Wittenberg in 1507—8 (SE. 32), 110
studied law for two years at Pavia (cf.
SE. 64); but returned home because
of the wars. He was LL. D. at Leipzig
c. 1515, and in 1519 was appointed
Ordinarius: in which capacity he de-
livered an oration of welcome to the
combatants in the Leipzig Disputation‚
June 1519, and made the acquaintance
of Luther (LE.2 197. 163). 111 1523 110
reluctantly resigned this office to be-
come Chancellor to Duke George of
Saxony3 but 011 the Duke’s death in
1539 he at once resumed it from his
successor, Breitenbach (l. 2811), and
held it in spite ofa flattering invitation
from Ingolstadt (VZE. 111). In 1541
he was compelled to re-enter political
life as Chaucellor to Duke Maurice; but
in 1549 he escaped to his estates on the
Elbe, below Meissen, where he passed
his remaining years in retirement (cf.
VZE. 153).

His acquaintance with Erasmus
probably began at this time3 and
though they never met, their relations
were always cordial. Pistorius sup-
ported the scholar’s frequent applica-
tions to Duke Gom-ge 3 and when
assured of his orthodoxy (cf. Lond.
xviii. 4, LB. 848: and Horawitz ii. 8),
proved a strong champion (EE. 56),
protecting him also against Eppendorff.

His influence was always exerted 011
the side of moderation (cf. LE.² 1702.
20-3 = ME. 766). But Luther in 1541-3
found him too orthodox‚ and a hin-
drance to schemes of reform (LE.2
3076, 3258, 3332) ; 50 also Jonas (JE.
637, 878). Melanchthon in 1547 wrote
to him with intimacy (ME. 4048, 4055).
He possessed a good library ; but wrote
little except some consilia published,
with those of his 5011, Modestinus, by
a grandson, at Leipzig in 1587—8.

O. Clemen prints for the first time a
Ratio discendarum legum written by Pis-
torius from Breslau, 13 May 1527.

28. Breytenbach] († c. 1541) matri-
culated at Leipzig in 1501, and by 1509
was in the confidential service of Duke
George (Ranke, Hist. os Refmmation, tr.
S. Austin‚ 1905, p. 9811). Ηο succeeded
Pistorius (1. 2711) as Ordinarius of the
Law Faculty, 1524-393 and was Vice-
Chancellor of the University in 1520
and 1535. 011 Duke George's death
he became Chaucellor to the Elector
Joachim of Brandenburg, 17 May 1540:
in whose service he died.

He was one of the friends to whom
Stromer (l. 24) dedicated an edition of
Aen. Sylvius' Libellus aulicorum miserias
copiose explicam, Mainz, J. Schoeffer,
6 July 1517. In Nov. 1519 he was on
friendly tei-ms with Luther (Lm 246) ς
but later was obliged to oppose him, in
helping Duke George to check the Re-
formation. Of„ however, JE. 429.
