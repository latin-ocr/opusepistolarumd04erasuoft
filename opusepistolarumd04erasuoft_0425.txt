1159. To R-ICHARD SBRULIUS.

Epistol-ae selectae, 1520, f0. 1³ v0 (α). Cologne.
F. p. 514: HN: Lond. xiii. 29: LB. 545. 13 November 1520.

[For the earliest source see App. 12 111 vol. iii. The year-date is confirmed by
the other letters of this period from Cologne.

R. Sbrulius (ο. 1480-p. 1525) of Udine was an adventurer of the same type as Bar-
tholinus (Ep. 547) and Andronicus (Ep. 991). The earliest date at which he can be
definitely traced is 13 Dec. 1506, when he was at Venice. At Constance in 1507
he attracted the attention os Maximilian with a poem on the Sforzas ; and this
led to an introduction to Duke Frederic of Saxony, who sent him to teach at
Wittenberg (see Ο. Beckman, Oratio ‘inlaude‘m philosophiae, VVittenberg, J. Gronen-
berg, 1510, ff. b3 νο, b⁴ νο). Thus when Scheurl was installed as rector of the
University‚ 1 May 1507, Sbrulius’ name appeared next to his in the matriculation-
lists. During his residence there Sbrulius published numerous complimentary
pcems, addressed to Duke Frederic and others 3 but of these Mutianus had little
opinion (MRE. 78, ΜΒΕ.2 58), and Eobanus in his Bucolicon, Erfurt, J. Knapp,
29 Sept. 1509, made fun. Nevertheless he won great admiration from Scheurl,
who ranked him with 0vid, and introduced Spalatinus to him with reverence
(SE 58, 59) 3 and this even survived the scandals which drove him from Witten-
berg in 1512—13. About May 1513 he matriculated at Frankfort on the Oder,
where he produced a poem on the glories of Brandenburg, printed by J. Hanaw,
15001. 1514. 111 May 1515 he visited Mutianus at Gotha3 but the verses that
he offered found no favour, and he was passed on (MRE. 473‚4; MRE.² 4956).
A few verses of compliment by him appear in Trithemius' Liber octo questionum,
oppenheim, J. Hasselberg, 20 Sept. 1515. His next effusion was a poem 111
praise of Treves and the Holy Coat, dedicated to the Abp., and printed by
Quentel at Cologne, 1516; where he matriculated 3ο Sept. 1516. In 1517 he
was teaching at Ingolstadt‚ where Urbanus Regius approved of him QVE. 107) ;
but by 15 May 1518 he was at Augsburg, presenting a petition to Maximilian.
Some verses printed in Zasius' Lucubrationes, Froben, 1518 (Ep. 862), perhaps
indicate a visit to Basle, where he may have met Erasmus (cf. Ep. 1001. 31-3) ; but
in November he was back again at Augsburg, dwelling with Paul Hosheimor,
Imperial organist (SE. 177). Some verses by him appear in a volume addressed
to the Imperial official, Blasius Holzelius, Augsburg, 1518, by a number of poets
who claimed Holzelius as their Maecenas. Maximilian appointed him historio-
grapher and poet ; and so 011 1110 Emperor’s death he composed an Elegy, which
was printed s. l. el a. In 1519-20 he published two more volumes of verse at
Augsburg : for one of which see p. 359. Hutten in May 1520 contemned him as
‘ homo extreme leuis et futilis ', who would spiu out verses 10 any one who would
give him a crust of bread (HE. 164) ; a judgement which is justified by Sbrulius‘
numerous contributions of this sort to books of the period (cf. l. 611 and NE.
p. 27). But besides the present polite letter Erasmus thought well enough of
him to make him, like Andronicus, one of the characters in the Conuiuium poeri-
cwn, first printed in Aug. 1523. In 1522 Sbrulius was teaching at Freiberg in
