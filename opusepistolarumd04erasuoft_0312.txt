THOMAS MORVS ERASMO S. D.

DE puero cuius causam commendasti mihi, iam ante cum patre eius

egeram quam tu scripsisti.

Rogarat enim pridem me per literas

puer ipse, quod sibi persuaserat apud illum meam sententiam
momenti aliquid ac ponderis habituram. Tractaui rem diligentem

5 quid profecerim haud satis certo scio.

1105. 61. Antonius] Engelbrecht († c.
1556—7) of Engen, after studying at
Leipzig c. 1503 and taking orders,
matriculated at Basle in the summer
of 1517. In 1520, being ‘baccalaureus
formatus’ in Theology‚ he was nomi-
natecl Suffragan Bp. of Spires, with the
title of Bp. of Termopoli; and there—
with parish-priest of Bruchsal. About
1524 his Bp. sought to remove him, for
sympathy with the new movement for
reform ; but his parishioners petitioned
that he might remain. In April 1525,
during the Peasants' Revolt, he fied
from Spires with the Bp., but was in·
vited to return (Bl. E. 93). He settled,
however, at Strasburg‚ as preacher at
St. Stephen's, and in Sept. 1526 his
bpric. was given to another. He
became more and more advanced in
his views, and married c. Nov. 1533
(Bl. E. 377, 396). But before long the
Strasburg Reformers found him an open
enemy of their Church, and expelled
him from his position ; though to the
profound regret of the citizens (see a
letter printed by A. Hegler in his
Beier. τ. Gesch. d. Mgsstik in d. Reforma-
tc'onswil. 1906, p. 345. B>- 1536 he had

returned to the Catholic side, and
settled in Cologne ; but in 1542 he was
still on friendly terms with T. Blaurer
and Hubert.

See F. X. Remling, Gesch. ol. Bischbjfe
:u Speyer, ii (1854), pp. 250‚1; and
Urkundenbuch, ii (1853), pp. 496-8:
also Bl. E. and VE. 758. A specimen
of his handwriting is given by J. Ficker
and Ο. VVinckelmann, Handschriflen-
probem des sechzehnten Jahrhunderts nach
Strassburqer Om'yinalen, ii, 1905, pl. 54.

1106. 1. puero] Perhaps Ant. of Ber-
gen, the younger (Epp. 760, 969 ; cf. Ep.
737. 3); the description of whom in
Epp. 717. 22-3, 1025. 9-16, agrees with
that here. There is no letter to More
in the packet which he carried to
England in Nov. 1519 (Epp. 1025 etc.) 3
but Erasmus' commendation to More
may have been in connexion with
Antony's return to England in 1520.
Antony perhaps wrote then to More
(11. 2-3), as he had written to VVolsey
(Brewer iii. 598).

patre] On the above identifica-
tion this would be John of Bergen (cf.
Ep. 737 insted), whom More would
have had many opportunities to meet.
