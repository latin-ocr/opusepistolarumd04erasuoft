to Dr. Seebohm's family, who have allowed me the freesb
access to his library at Hitchin, and prolonged use of some
os his books. Inter amicos bene actum est.

The only change of principle in the editing of this volume is

thala I have decided for the future to discard notice of variants—

usually mere lapses—in the text, of Lond. which have no aubhoriby

and which are corrected in LB. They afford evidence of the care

taken with the Leiden text3 but there are too many of them.

The comparatively few cases in which LB. repeats the misreadings

of Lond. are preserved: as supplying indisputable proof that

Lond. served as the basis of LE„ perhaps in the same way as it

does for the present edition.
