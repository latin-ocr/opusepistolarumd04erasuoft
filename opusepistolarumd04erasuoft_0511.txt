1196. To VINCENT THEODORICI.

Epistolae ad diuersos p. 601. <Louvain.>
HN: Lond. xvi. 14: LB. 562. (c. March> 1521.

[An approximate mouth-date can be assigned from ll. 151-2. The identity of the
person addressed is obvious, even without the name left in 1. 315 —probably by
mistake‚ since an endeavour was made to disguise it in the Corrigenda. In later
years Erasmus made no secretos it (Lond. xix. 13, LB. 862) : but, though that
letter was published in H, he only replaced the concealing ‘N ' of this letter, in
the same edition, by a clerisive and transparent pseudonym (cf. Ep. 1342. 139).

Vincent Theodorici (c. 1481—4 Aug. 1526) of Beverwyk, between Alkmaar and
Haarlem (cf. Ep. 1166. 42n)‚ joined the Dominicans at Haarlem, and was sent
for his education to Paris3 where he lectured on the Seutences, and in 1514 was
B.D. In the same year he dedicated to Michael of Pavia (Ep. 85. Ion), who
until 1512 had been his patron, an edition of Petrus de Palude’s connnentary on
Book 4 of the Sentences, Paris, F. Regnault and C. Chevallon, 23 Jan. 1518.
His preface commemorates Petrus de Brussellis. a Dominican who had been his
tutor. Vincent also collaborated with anot-her Dominican, Peter of Nymegen, in
editing Aquinas' Summa, pt. 3, Paris, C. chevallon, 1514, a volume which
1 have not seen. Subsequently he migrated to Louvain3 where he was Lic.
Theol. 30 June 1517 and Dr. 13 Oet„ and was Dean of the Faculty 29 Aug.
1521. He was twice Regent of studies in the Dominican house there; and in
1525 was Inquisitor for the diocese of Utrecht.

From his earliest days in Louvain (cf. 1. 8) he began to criticize Erasmus,
and by 1520 had united with Egmondanus as one of his bitterest opponents: see
Epp. 1144, 1164-6‚ 1186. Later, under the assumed name of Godefridus Ruysius
Taxander, he attacked Erasmus· Exomoloyesz's and De esu carnium (see Ep. 1274. 14n)
with an Apologia, Antwerp‚ S. Cocus, 21 March 1525, dedicated to Erasmus’
former adversary, Edward Lee. For this Erasmus revenged himself by a
caricature of Vincent in the colloquy Funus, first printed in Feb. 1526; which
represents the friar as hanging over a deathbed and settling the dying mau's
will in favour of the mendicant orders (cf. Ep. 1162. 165-6).
