456 LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1521

this year τ one without name of place or printer‚ the other printed by A. Pafraed
at Deventer in May. 1 have not been able to examine either of these. But it
seems a reasonable conjecture that the former is the unauthorized reprint of
which Erasmus complains in this preface, needing revision before he could allow
it to appear with his sanction ; and that Pafraed's volume is a reprint of Martens’.
If this view is correct, the preface here can be dated within nari-ow limits.

In addition to α there is another source for this profane—a ms. leaf (B) written
by Hand A of the Gouda MSS. (see App. 9 in vol. i) and inserted in a copy of
the Confic. Epist. Formula (1. 511), Antwerp, M. Hillen, 23 July 1521, which has
recently (Jan. 1918) come into my possession. As in other of the prefaces copied
by Hand A, the ms. variants are not decisive enough to determine whether β is
derived from an independent source or was copied carelessly from the Progymna-
smata as printed in α. Hand A heads his copy with the words, ‘Opusculum
sequens de compendiaria formula conficiendarum epistolarum Erasmus negat
esse suum: sed sub nomine eius ab alio est aeditum ⁷. The dates at the end may
have been concocted from the colophon of a printed original.]

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS STVDIOSAE IVVENTVTI S. D.

IMPVDENTER faciunt qui mea me viuo publicant formulis typo-
graphorum 3 sed multo impudentius qui pueriles etiam naenias meas
euulgant. Omnium autem impudentissime qui nugis alienis meum
praefigunt nomen: id quod nuper fecit nescioquis, qui libellum emisit
De ratione conscribendi epistolas3 in quo praeter pauculas voces
furtiuas nihil est meum. Nec vnquam mihi quisquam notus fuit cui
nomen esset Petro Paludano.

Olim puer, quia minus valebam carmine elegiaco, coeperam excer-
cere me ceu declamatiunculis aliquot in eo genere, et has semel atque
iterum euulgatas video. In quibus non intelligo quid sit quod
mereatur publicum, nisi forte vt exemplo pueri puerorum ingenia
prouocentur‚ vt malint excercere stilum in argumentis huiusmodi

5. conscribendi epistolas] Not the
little volume with this name which
Siberch produced without permission
at Cambridge in 1521, with the preface
to Robert Fisher (Ep. 71), as originally
written in Paris3 but the Breuissima
maximeque compendiaria conficiendarum
Epistolarum formula, which has a preface
closely resembling Ep. 71, addressed to
Peter Paludanus—zi fictitious name
perhaps invented out of other dedica-
tions of Erasmus (cf. Epp. 66 and 180).

For this composition BEr1. mentions
an edition by Schoeffer at Mainz, Sept.
1520 ; and others of 1520 at Leipzig and
by Maler at Erfurt. 1 have not been
able to examine any of these, and have
no idea which was the earliest, nor
who was responsible for the publica-
tion. In any case it must be prior to
Siberch's volume. The connexion
between tho Conficienclarzmz Epistocarum
formula and thc De conscribendis Epistolis
is not easy to trace: but evidently
there were two versions at least of the

Paris composition in circulation at this
time. The rough-drafts for a letter of
Basil Amerbach, dated 6 July 1522
(Basle MSS. G. II. 13. 123³-5)÷ mention
‘ Modum conficiendarum epistolarum
Moguntiae⁷ and ‘Modum epistolandi
sub titulo Erasmi ab aliquibus aeditum'
as the moving cause which impelled
Erasmus to rewrite his Paris essay into
the De conscribendis Epistozis, Bas-le, Fro-
ben, Aug. 1522 (Ep. 1284).

It was only at the end of his life that
Erasmus could be induced to counten·
ance the publication of the Confic. Epist.

formula. In March 1536 it appeared at

Basle, printed by T. Platter and B.
Lasine, in conjunction with a little
treatise by Vives on the same subject ;
and on the last page a brief letter from
Erasmus to the reader, disclaiming
Peter Paludanus, of whom, with the
failing memory of old age, he had re-
cently heard anew (Lond. xxvii. 42,
LB. 1295). The Lyons edition there
mentioned is not known to BEr1. and
is very likely a figment.
