1041. ΤΟ THE READER.

Colloquiorum Formulae f0. h⁵ v0. Louvain.
<0. November 1519.)

[A letter appendecl to Martens' enlarged edition of the Colloquiorum Formzczae
(c. Nov. 1519) (Ep. 909 introd.), and described on the title-page as ‘ Contestatio
aduersus seditiosas calumnias’. In order to contain it, the last sheet, h, is
extended to six leaves; so that it was perhaps written at the very end of the
printing‚ and should thus be dated rather later than Ep. 1040. But the
numerous points of resemblance in ll. 33—45 to Ep. 1033. 24-5, 57-68, 192-3‚
show that in date this cannot be far distant from 19 Oct. In the Apologia qua
respondet (f0. F2 v⁰ 3 Jortin. ii. 520) Erasmus states that he was not present when
the book was printed ; perhaps being away at Brussels or Antwerp gcf. p. 111).

In writing this letter his purpose evidently was to keep himself from being
involved in the still undetermined controversy about Reuchlin and the troubles
which Luther was raising: cf. Ep. 1033 introd. To what extent he writes
iugenuously is not clear. With regard to Ep. 713 it may be pointed out that
the form given by both authorities is Christiam'sres, not christianista, and that
there are several small changes in β from the textos a: but it may be questioned
whether Erasmus would have resorted to quite so narrow an equivoeation. If
he is given the benefit of the doubt, it follows that the words to which he
objects were not 111 Ep. 713 as he wrote it, and that the text of that letter was
otherwise changed. As to Ep. 980, his denial of the mention there of the
Bishop of Liege only amounts to saying that the name is not found in E ς and
therefore probably does not invalidate the unauthorized text.- But the sugges·
tion in ⁴ nescio qui euulgarunt’ (1. 23N, as compared with Ep. 1040. 4, that he was
not cognizant of the publication of E, may be taken only as part of his habitual
affectation of modesty in the matter; cf. App. 7. Ι11 any case it is to be
noticed that he does not deny the general authenticity of either lettera]

ElerMVS ROTEROD. AMICO LECTORI S. D.

Rvnsvs extitisse doleo, lector amice, de quo malui vel intempe-
stiuius admonere quam errare quenquam. Prorsus inciuiliter factum
quod typographorum temeritas Epistolis ad Reuchlinum iam olim
euulgatis nuper adiecit quasdam nostras, haudquaquam in hoe scriptas
vt ederentur ; sed inciuilius est quod in his quaedam odiose mutarunt.
Nullam enim recusare mulctam, si in autographis quas ad Reuchli·
num scripsi, deprehendantur haec verba, ‘non Christianus, sed
Christianista‘: ne quid de caeteris dicam. Scio Reuchlinum virum
prudentiorem quam qui pateretur haee fieri; nec dubito quin 1100
inscio commissum sit ab iis qui Reuchlino sedulo magis quam pru-
