1 1 2 2] TO MATTHIAS MEYNER 303

The whole pac-ket of letters, 1122-8, was probably sent by the same hand,
Draco (Epp. 1124, 1127; cf. JE. 43) ; whose journey back to Erfurt would lie
through Mainz. and perhaps Wurzburg‚ and who would have facilit-‚ies for sor-
warding to Leipzig and Dresden.

Henry of Eppendorff (l. 10), near Freiberg in Meissen. matriculated at Leipzig
in 1506, and was B.A. 11 March 15083 and c. 1511-12 Melanchthon had formed
an ill opinion of him (cf. ME. 267 with Ep. 1496). Little else is known of
him before his visit to Erasmus at Louvain in July 1520 (Epp. 1122, 1125).
Ηο claimed to be of knightly rank ; but this was disputed by both Mosellanus
(Ep. 1437) and Emser (Ep. 1551). The change in 1. 11 made in F is, however,
noticeable. Duke George of Saxony gave him money to carry on his studies
(Ep. 1437); and from Louvain he went to Freiburg, where he can be traced in
June 1521 (Basle MS. C. VIa. 73. 222: H. Schreiber5 Gesch. Univ. Freiburq, ii. 193)
and March 1522 (App. 14). At one time there he was involved in a suit for debt
(Schreiber, op. cit„ ii. 100). By May 1522 110 had been for some while at Basle
(Ep. 1283). He attached himself to Erasmus (Basle MS. G. II. 13. 123“).
whom he accompanied in Sept. to visit Botzheim at Constance (cf. ΒΓΕ.
226,7). In Dec. Erasmus could still write of him with approbation to Duke
George (Ep. 1325) : but when the 111-03011 between Hutten and Erasmus
began, Eppendorff followed Hutten and quiekly drew away from his former
friend (cf. App. 14). In the present letter may be seen signs of growing coolness.

011 Hutten's death Eppendorff withdrew to Strasburg‚ where he communicated
his dislike of Erasmus to Otho Brunfels (HE. 334, p. 350) and others (Ep. 1466) ;
among whom, to Erasmus' disgust, was Capito (Ep. 1485 ι cf. Epp 1459, 1496).
As a result of the attack upon himself Erasmus wrote to Duke Geor-ge (κ 11011110-
ing Eppendorff. The letter was never published 3 hut it reached Eppendorff. and
supplied him with a handle against Erasmuswhich he was not slow to use (of. Epp.
1448, 9). For some years he repeatedly threatened an action for defamation (Lond.
xix. 72, 58 ς LB. 906. 927); and at length, as there was no abatement ofErasmus’ lan-
guage, he came to Basle to carry out his threat (Horawitz i. 11, ii. 8⁸. Pr eeedings
were only averted by the intervention of Bonisace Amerbach. Beatus Rhs nanus,
and L. Ber ; who on 3 Feb. 1528 established a sort of peace between them (LB. App.
346 ; cf. Hess ii. 6034). But the settlement was not satisfactory (LBv 058) and
Erasmus was tardy in fulfilling his part (cf. LB. 1087,8; and Basl(¹ MS. C. VIR.
73. 89). Early in 1529 he sent a written account of the position to Duke Georgo
(cf. LB. App. 348,9); and in the colloquy, Ἱππεὺς ἄνιππος. first printfd in the
Froben edition of March 1529, the chief character was so lightly disguised as to
be easily recognizable (cf. Ep. 1168. 19n and EE. 111). For a time the move to
Freiburg seemed to give relief ν Lond. xxiv. 4, LB. 1060). Next year Eppendorff

' went to Augsburg to meet the Duke at the Diet and expound his side of the case
s* (EE. 128, 1373 cf. Lond. xxv. 30, 42, LB. 1118, 1208); and 011 return visited

Erasmus at Freiburg with some degree of amity (BHE. 275 ; cf. Lond. xxx: 53,
LB. 1146). But neither was satisfied. Erasmus produced for publication a stale-
ment of his position, Aduersus mendacium . . . vtilis admonitio. Freiburg. sn.. 15303
and Eppendorff replied with a Iusla Qwerela, Hagmau, J. S verius, Feb. 1531.
After this, through the mediation of J. Pflug,sent by Duke George (J. p 60, and
Lond. xxvi. 1, LB. 1168), the quarrel was happily allowed to lapse3 though
Erasmus· apprehensions continued (Lond. xxx. 56. LB. 1205).

The accusations made against Eppendorff by Erasmus are mitigated hy what
is otherwise known of his life. He appears as a friend and patron of men of
letters (BRE. 239: ΕΕ.2 69). Even so firm an adher nt of Erasmus as Boniface
Amerbach treated him with respect (Brsle MS. C. Vlss. 73 89. 124). Between
him and Volz there were close ties (BRE. 343. 348: cf. App. 14). Huttich (Ep.
550 introd.) speaks well of him in the preface to Imperatores Romam. strasburg,
W. Cephalaeus. 1526, f0. A ⁸ From 1523 onwards he lived quietly at Sti-asburg.
occupied largely in literary pursuits. Scholt printed for him translati ns into
German of Plutareh's Apophrheymata, 1534. and Monilia, 1535, and of some books
of Pliny N. H.. 15433 of A. Krantzius' Chronicon Daniae. 1545, and of various
writings about the 'rurks‚ 1550: also a short History of Rome· in German. 1536
(cs. SE. 246, 256), and in 1551 a collected volume of some of these. The datr· of
his death is unknown.
