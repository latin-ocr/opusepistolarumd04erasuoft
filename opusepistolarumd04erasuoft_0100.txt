60 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1519

appears to have used not the rough-drafts but-the text printed by Erasmus in
(3¹ ι 000 vol. ii, p. xx.

The section of Budaeus’ Greek letters in b, of which this is one, aroused con-
tinued interest throughout the century. Shortly before Budaeus· death (23 Aug.
1540) 11 young scholar, Wm. Plancius or Plautius of Le Mans—afterwards well-
known for his translations from Plutarch, Hippocrates, and Galen, and for his
edition of the Pharmacia of his master, John Fernelius—, asked permission to edit
them again; and Budaeus, readily assenting, lent his own copy of the letters
with further corrections and improvements by himself. Plancius’ volume,
G. Βιιᾱαει· yraecae epistolae, ab ipso nuper tum locupletiores tum emendatiores redditae,
Paris, C. Wechel‚ 1540 (0¹), represents therefore the final polish given to the
letters by their author. It is followed by two reprints issued by the Wechel
firm in Paris, 1550 (0²) and 1556: the latter of which Ι have not seen. Later
Ant. Piehonius of La Chartre on the Loir, who in 1585 was Regius Professor of
Greek at Tours, produced a Latin translation of the Greek letters, and 111 1110
0111110 time made a few corrections in the text, Paris, J. Benenatus, 1574 (d).
Finally in imitation of Tusanus' notes on BEl. and BE2. (Ep. 810. 45on)‚ Clau-
dius Credonius Colaeneus published a volume of notes, grammatical rather than
explanatory, Paris, J. Februarius, 1579.

In the sigla a of course has the priority z for the sake of convenience 1 have
placed b, c, d after N, and have neglected the occasional, but unimportant,
variants of Lond. and LB. The corrections made in N2 at ll. 30, 74 [cf. Ep.
1073. 4511) perhaps imply that its editors had seen b. There is a mS. copy 111 the
British Museum (Harl. 1675, ff. 99 v0-103 z c. 1591); but it is incomplete and
otherwise of no value, and probably was made from one of the printed volumes.

The mouth-date given for this letter in all the contemporary editions is
identical with that for Ep. 1015, 15 Sept. Both letters answer Ep. 10043 but
this was written somewhat the earlier, and not long after the arrival of Ep. 1004
(Ep. 1015. 166-8). The correction required might be made in either letter. Thus
Leclerc dates this 15 Aug. 3 or in Ep. 1015. 165 Nouembris might be read for Octobris,
or Septimo for septimodecimo. But 1ιο 1110 postscript to Ep. 1015 shows that this letter
was brought back and the two sent off at the same time, though by different
messengers, it seems easiest to suppose that the mouth· date was altered here,
pershap by Budaeus himself, to accoid with that of the second dispatch.1n any
case Longclius’ movements (l 411) make Lecleic’ s correction impossible; for
11. 3-11 show that by the time Ep. 1004 reached Budaeus, Longolius had
already left Paris. Ep. 1023. 2 also indicates that when he left, Budaeus had
not yet written to Erasmus. The letters were not delivered quickly3 for on
2 Jan. 1520 Budaeus wrote to Vives (BE⁴. 51), in answer to a letter not extant,
‘Quod miraris me non scribere, velim vt scias Erasmi epistolae nouissimae
Graece et Latine rescripsisse ‘'. By 2 Feb. he had heard that they had arrived
(BE4. 52).]
