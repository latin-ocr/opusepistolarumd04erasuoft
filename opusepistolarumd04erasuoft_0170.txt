D. Nicolaus, praeses Hellandiae et ceterarum prouintiarum, ita
amplectitur vt numquam letius prandeat quam de te cum est prolixa
et in primis honorifica mentio, eaque de eausa magno fauore me pro-
sequitur. Quidam domini consiliarii omnibus modis student bene
mereri de me, quod audierint, et in Oratione aperte legerint, me ex

animo tuum esse. Omnes scholae, omnia eruditorum conuenticula‚

5 omnis magnatum corona Erasmum predicat3 inter quos precipuus

est magnificus idemque illustris ac doctus dominus de Assendelft,
qui tuis monimentis vniee delectatur, ea in manibus habet pene

assidue, quum vacat.

Me student hic inaurare. Non desunt passim eximii viri religiosi
Inter quos

hortatione non foret opus.

his great—uncle Hugo, founder of the

vice-curate at Haarlem, under Nic.
Ruistre (Ep. 177), and took part in
Philip’s enthronement there, 24 June
1497. He received a canonry at the

On 20 July 1509 he became consul at

suppression of heresy (de Hoop
Scheffer, Gesch. (I. Kerkheru. in Nederl.,
pp. 393, 590). See also Ep. 1166 introd.

some post in connexion with the
Grovernment of Holland at the Hague :

script. ord. Minormn, 1806, p. 1333 and
BN. Sanderus, Clwrogtraplzz'a sacra

34. Amandus] of Zierikzee ;[† 8 June 2
1524), of the Franciscan house at
Louvain. His Chronica mundi was
printed at Antwerp, S. Cocus. May
15343 with a prefaee by Franc.
Titelmann, 6 May, which contains al-
most 311 that is known about him. This
credits him with 111011616116)7 inHebrew,
Syriae, Greek, history and divinity,
and praises his sweetness of character
and humility and patience in long
suffering. He composed commentaries
on Genesis, Ecclesiastes. and Job, and
wrote other theologica} works: also
‘De Sophi, rege Persarum, hoste Tur-
carum', 1518.

NVadding, op. cit„ p. 11, gives the
date of his death from the obit-book of
the Franciscans at Louvain, but con-
jectures that it should be 1534,
because the Chroniele goes down to
that year: so also BWN. i. 239.
Titelmann, however, speaks as though
Amandus had been dead some time;
so that 1524 may be accepted. The
continuation of the Chronicle may
probably be attributed to Titelmann.
