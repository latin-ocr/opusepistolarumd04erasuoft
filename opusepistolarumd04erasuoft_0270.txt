226 LETTERS OF ERAsMUs

[1520
adeo non amicitia contracta est vlla, vt nec litera quidem vlla inter·
cesserit: at neque cum ipso Rhenano, vt omittam plurimos eruditione
non incelebres. Quod si Brixius fingat hos omnes adulari mihi,
multum ei debeo qui tam magnum virum me facit. Sin caecOS,

360 inscios atque indoctos omnes pronunciet, quoniam sic ab ipso dissen-
tiunt, vt quem ille toties stultum vocat, toties appellat insanum, ei,
vt nihil recenseam amplius, aliquanto certe plusculum tribuant pru-
dentiae quam adhuc audio, praeter Brixium, quenquam tribuisse
Brixioz nemo ei tam absoluta potestate dictaturam detulit, vt eius

365 vnius sententiam ita ratam esse oporteat, quin ad populum saltem
supersit prouocatio.

Nam quod hoc ita moleste fert, quod Rhenanus Epigrammata mea
Marulli et Pontani praetulerit, debebat aliquanto pressius Rhenani
laudationes expendere: qui etsi multo mihi tribuit amplius quam

370 meus pudor possit agnoscere, tamen ea parte qua potissimum Brixius
offenditur, non adeo effusus est in laudes meas vt Brixius inuidere
debuerit. Neque enim me Pontano aut Marullo vndecunque praefert
Rhenanus aut confert. Natura tantum comparat, non Graecarum
literarum peritia: ne sit opus vt ita stomachetur Brixius Graeco

375 conferri Britannum. Etenim natura quid impedit etiam Graeco
parem quempiam,

Veruecum in patria crassoque sub aere nasci?

358. Quod si ιῙογτῖνιε Quasi α.

 

 

For the former lie composed a broad-
sheet, for the latter a congratulatory
poem, Diui Caroli . . . slesgzsderatissz'mus
reditus: both printed by Hillen. He
quickly became attracted by schemes
of moderate reform in the Church. In
152o-1 he edited two works by John
Gochius3 and Diircr (Tayebuclz, ed. F.
Leitschuh, 1884, pp. 76-7‚ 89) received
from him a copy of Luther’s Capt. Baby-
lonica (Ep. 1153. 146n) in June 1521.
Soon after the arrest of Nic. of Herto-
genbosch (Ep. 616. 14n) Grapheus was
arrested 011 5 Feb. 1522 at the order of
Egmondanus and Hulst, and under
pressure made an abject recantation in
April. His life was spared ; but 111
spite of a piteous appeal, 18 N ov. 1522,
to John Carondelet (Ep. 803. 1211), 111
which he gives some account of him-
sels, he was detained at Brussels and
not allowed to return to Antwerp till
Nov. 1523 (ΕΕ. 19). A letter thence to
Diirer. 23 Feb. 1524, shows the caution
to which for the rest of his life he was
bound, in speaking of religion.

He remained at Antwerp and slowly
re-established his reputation byliterary
work. In 1528 he dedicated to Caron-
(lelet the De Sculptura of Pomponius
Gauricus of Naples ; in 1531—2 he com·
posed some colloquiorum Formulae out
of Terence ; in 1541, with his eolleague

Peter Gilles, an Enchiridion principzs ac
mayistratus Christiani ; in 1543 a Para-
phrase on Ps. 1233 and he published
numerous little volumes of verse. In
1540 his secretaryship was restored to
him3 and he wrote elaborate descrip*
tions of the ceremonies observed on
Chai-les' institution of the Senate at
Antwerp in 1540 and on Philip’s re-
ception there in 1549. An epitome of
olaus Magnus' Hist. de yemibus septen-
trionalibus is his work ; though printed,

Antwerp, C. Flamin, 1558, without i

his name. Erasmus writes of him with
praise in two letters of 14 July 1522,
and thought of leaving him money in
his time of need3 and their relations
were always cordial.
