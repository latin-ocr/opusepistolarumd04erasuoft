1037] FROM EDWARD LEE 109

initials of Vrs Graf and the Basler Stab. also the date 1519. The book perhaps
appeared c. 15 Feb. 1520; for by 17 Feb. Erasmus had heard at Louvain that
it was out (Ep. 1066. 88-90), though on 21 Feb. he had not yet seen it (Ep. 1068.
14-17). By 27 Feb. More had seen copies at Greenwich (Env. pp. 81,2 ; Jortin
ii. 659‚6o). But these were perhaps sent in advance, for the book seems not
to have reached Basle till c. 14 March (Epp. 1083. 1, 1084. 66-7: cf. Zw. Ε.2 124,
BRE. 159 and Basle MS. C. ΥΡ. 73. 298, 397) ; and it was at Cologne about the
same time (Ep. 1078).

By the appearance of this volume Erasmus? long embroilment with Lee was
brought to a head. The controversy fills an inordinate space in his coi-respon-
denec, and no doubt occupied his thoughts also at this period to a very large
extent. The case has been sufficiently stated by the two combatants from their
different points of view: by Lee in his letter to the Louvain students and in
Ep. 1061 ; by Erasmus in Epp. 1053, 1074, and more fully in three apologies or
replies, the first of which, Apoloqia nihil habens neque nasi neque dentis neque stomachi
'neque vnyuz’um, qua respondet duabus inuectiuis Eduarclt Lei, Antwerp, M. Hillen,
(c. March) 1520, is not reprinted in his works (cf. 1, p. 22. 18-21), but may be
found in J ortin ii. 496—528.

The points of the dispute need not be examined here in detail, but the chrono-
logy of the various incidente may be given briefly. When Erasmus first met Lee
(Ep.765 introd.) on coming to settle at Louvain in July 1517 (cf. Ep. 1074 and Lee's
Annot. f0. AA2), he was already aware that the young Englishman had attacked
him (Ep. 1074. 17-233 cf. Ep. 973. 7). During the following autumn and winter
Lee made some criticisms on the Nouum Instmmentmn, and spoke of producing
some notes. These Erasmus asked to see, but for some reason only a few
actually reached him at first (cf. Ep. 750 introd.). Then, just before he went to
Basle in May 1518, a larger collection was forthcoming (cf. Ep. 886. 58—78),
which he answered in detail (Ep. 843). 011 his return to Louvain in the autumn
there was talk of more, and these he tried to secure, first by a personal inter·
view (Ep. 1581 : later than 22 Oct„ cf. Ep. 886. 73), and then even by under-
hand methods (cf. Ep. 998. 1711), but without success, After some weeks of
wrangling, recourse was suggested to the judgement of frIends. Lee's notes
were sent first, without Erasmus having been allowed to see them, to the Vice-
Chancellor of the University‚ Jo. Briardus Atensis (cf. Epp. 998, 1061. 666-7,
794, 10743 and Lee's sznot. f0. ΒΒ r0. and v⁰.)‚ who, however, after keeping

¹ them for a month or two (cf. Ep. 1061. 780; Apol. qua respondet, f0. G3, Jortin

ii. 526), declined to act—to the great relief of Erasmus, who had not much
confidence in his impartiality (Apol. qua respondet f0. B, Jortin ii. 5003 cf.
Epp. 1029. 311, 1053. 29611). Α sentence from a letter of Erasmus to Lee at this
period, preserved in the latter's Annos. f0. 3132, ‘Quod agere destinaueramus, alias
agetur per ocium ⁹, is expressive of his satisfaction. Lee states (ibid.) that this
was about the period when Erasmus was sending off to Basle the final ‘ copy’
for the second edition of the New Testament (cf. Apol. qua respondet, f0. ΒΞ, J ortin
ii. 500), therefore about the end of 1518 (cf. Ep. 864 introd).

By this time Erasmus was seriously annoyed with his critic (cf. Epp. 906.
448—66, 912). The ostensible question debated between them subsequently was
about the productiori of Lee's notes, Erasmus averring that Lee had withheld
them in spite of his repeated requests (cf. EEv. pp. 86‚7)‚ Lee stating that Erasinus
and his friends had received with such contumely those that were shown to
them that he was justified in withdrawing from the field. But this issue is too
paltry to account for the extreme acerbity shown on both sides. A more
plausible explanation may be conjectured in a mutual antipathy between the
young aspirant for honour in the world of theology and the mature and suc-
cessful scholar, high on a pinnacle of fame, almost dictator to the admiring
circle round him. More, writing to Lee in May 1519, describes him as ‘olim
non admodum aequum in Erasmum’ (ΕΑΕ. f0. D³ v⁰.; EEv. p. 67; Jortin ii.
653), words which suggest that in entering the lists Lee may have been led by
a desire to lower his antagonist's pride (cf. Ep. 1074. 18). Such personal
feeling, doubtless easily recognizaffle, might well have rendered criticisms, which
were otherwise inoffensive, extremely unwelcome to the older scholar, and have
moved him to conduct the controversy without moderation, which in such
cases he always found difficult. Quite likely, too, there was ground for the
suggestion (cf. Epp. 973. 7—1o‚ 993. 28-33, 998. 42-7) that Lee was encouraged by
some of the orthodox theologians at Louvain, which Erasmus repeated fre-ely
