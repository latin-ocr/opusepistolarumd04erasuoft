and accepting its professors already appointed, without requiring from them
the formality of supplication (cf. 1. 411). For external teachers in general the
requirement was still enforced 3 and thus Vives obtained it on 3 March. Nesen,
however, seems never to have applied for it, being doubtless indignant at hisv
treatment over this matter. In April he was away at Erfurt, probably in quest
of employment under more liberal conditions (Ep. 1088. 10); and he perhaps
visited Pirckheimer also at Nuremberg (Ep. 1095 introd.) By 31 July he had
gone off to Frankfort (Ep. 1126. 356—7).

As in Ep. 1046 Erasmus' influence was again exerted on behalf of the College
with which he was 50 much in sympathy. For Nesen he had no strong personal
feeling ; and with his conservative instincts he might have been expected to side
with constituted authority. But authority in this case was coincident with his
opponents, and the present contest was only another form of the struggle that
he was continually wagi'ng for the freedom of liberal studies. So he was glad

enough to appeal to a member of the Council of Brabant; before which the
question had been brought.

Of the person whom he addressed nothing seems otherwise to be known. A
Jodocus de Nooth of Brussels entered at Bologna on 26 Jan. 1516 as a student
(ANGB. p. 280) ; but he could hardly have been a member of the Council of
Brabant four years later. Possibly Erasmus had the Christian name wrong (cf.
Ep. 1054 introd.) and was intending the Chancellor’s brother and successor,
Adolphus : or he may have been thinking of Josse Laurens, who was a member

of 11ιῖ 00011011, and whom he couples with the Chancellor in letters of 14 July
1522.
