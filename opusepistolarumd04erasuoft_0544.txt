LETTERS OF ERASMUS

[1521

To WILLIAM WARHAM.

Antwerp.
24 May 1521.

[1 cannot definitely establish the year-date from the. contents3 though the
payment of Erasmus' Imperial pension points to 1521, when the Court had
returned from Spain. But the verbal resemblances with other letters of this
period, especially Ep. 1228, give ample corroboration. Brewer (iii. 260) corrects
to 15193 but the entire difference of matter from Epp. 973,4‚ with which he

groups this, is conclusive against the change.

Also this would naturally have

appeared, like those letters, in E, if it had lieen written in 1519.
Of this visit to Antwerp Ι find no other indication]

1. Zacharias] Deiotarus († c. 1532ss
of Friesland3 a distich by whom, as
‘'Zach. Diotorus Phrisius’, appears at
the end of Wm. Horman's Vulqaria,
London, R. Pynson‚ 1519. If he had
already settled in England by that
date, it is not impossible that he should
be identified with the John of Fries-
land who left Erasmus in Sept. 1517 to
seek his fortune in England (cf. Ep.
637. 1311). Zacharias was now in
Warham's service3 and the rest of his
life seems to have been spent in Eng-
land, where he came into contact with
many of Erasmus' notable friends (cf.
Epp. 1366, 1490, 1491&

Tlnough not in affluent circumstan-
ces, he regularly received into his house
the servants whom Erasmus sent over

‹jvnussmuo adal. H.

as messengers. His letters (Ep. 1694.
ΕΕ. 115, 152) show him as a devoted
and loyal admirer of Erasmus3 whom
he was always delighted to serve. He
is mentioned in a letter of 16 March
1532 (Basle MS. Scheti Epist„ f. 39) as
having recently forwarded money to
Erasmus. By April 1533 he was dead ;

money being no doubt Erasmus'pen-

introd.).
