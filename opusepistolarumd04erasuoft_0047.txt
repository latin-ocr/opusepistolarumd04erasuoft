9981061 To EDWARD LEE.

F. p. 622: ΗΝ; Lond. xvii. 1: LB. 446 15 July 1519.

[Between the publication of Latomus’ Dialogue 1 47) and the appearance ot
the. Farrago (E) in Oct. -Nov. 1519 (see p.119).1t marks another attempt by
Erasmus—later than the trickery mentioned in 1. 17n—to obtain a sight of the
notes on the Nouum Ins-trumentum of which Lee was openly multiply' ing and
circulating copies, but without allowing him to see. ‘ Interim vbi nullus esset
neque modus neque finis iactandi trecentas annotationes, coepi odiosius etiam
prouocare ad aedffionem, primum verbis, mox per epistolam aed1tam, sed quae
sic haberet nonnihil aculeorum vt Leuni extimulare posset⁷ atrum facere non
posset ' τ Apoloyz'a qua respondet ff. B² νο, ΒΕ, J ortin ii. 501.

Apparently it was not sent off at once ; for Lee says (Ep. 1061. 2,3) that the
Farrayo was on sale at Louvain before the manuscript reached him. In replying
to it in Ep. 1061, he reprints it section by section. For the greater part his text
agrees more or less closely, after allowing for the depravation incidental to
copying or printing, with that of E, even to the reproduction of the inaccurate
name (cf. l. 4n): but at the end, for ll. 56—77‚ he gives a considerably shorter
form. This perhaps indicates that in the brief interval before sending the letter
to Basle to be included in E, Erasmus amplified the conclusion.

Epp. 307, 1006, 998 are the last three letters at the end of E; but in F, which
reprints E and all the preceding volumes of Epistolae—usually in strict order—‚
their position is quite different. Ep. 307 is there printed twice over, first on
p. 472, where it marks the end of Ε and is followed by 142 pages of new letters¹
(Lond. xii. 8-xvi. 18), and again on p. 615 wheie itis followed by Epp. 1006, 998:
after which come m01e new letters (Lond. xvii. 2-26). An explanation of this
unexpected arrangement may perhaps be found 1n a letter from Burer at Basle‚
12 Nov. 1519, to Beatus Rhenanus at Schlettstadt (BRE. 133)· . E1asmus . . .
epistolas duas sero post factum misit: iam enim Farrago ab incude prodierat.’
Now in E Ep. 307 ends at the foot of a page, Κ2 v0, p. 3883 after which come
Epp. 1006, 998, the two last letters in the book⁷ filling leaves Kss-L. It is quite
possible therefore that the first copies of E ended with Ep. 307, the remaining
leaves of sheet K being occupied with the Index> epistolarum and Index ternionum ;
and that when Erasmus sent Epp. 1006. 998. they were added in copies printed
later. The Froben firm no doubt retained for its own use specimens of the
various books produced in its presses, and would thus naturally take one of E in
its first form. If we suppose that it was forgotten to replace this ‘ office-copy '
