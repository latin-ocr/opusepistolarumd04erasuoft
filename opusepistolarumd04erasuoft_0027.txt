ADDENDA xxi

Ep. 104. In the British Museum is an illuminated ms. (Egerton 1651) of
ten leaves octavo, containing Ep. 104 prefixed to a number of poem3‚ most
of which are by Erasmus—the Hymns addressed to the Angels and to
St. Anne, the three poems to Gaguin and Faustus Andrelinus men-
tioned in 1, p. 3, and the Expostulatio Iesu; and in addition four short
poems, which appear to be unpublished—an epigram of Gaguin
inviting Faustus and Herasmus to come and visit him, two poenis by
Erasmus in praise of Skelton (Ep. 104. 64), and In castigationes Vin-
centiz' contra Malleoli castiqatoris deprauationes. Though the MS. does not
contain the Prosopopoeia‚ it is very likely a special copy of some of
Erasmus' poems prepared for presentation to Prince Henry after the
visit to Eltham in the autumn of 1499.

The text of Ep. 104 in the ms. varies widely from that afterwards
printed, and is considerably shorter. For example, for the passage
‘Quem (l. 29) . . . cupias’ (l. 47) the ms. reads: ‘Quem quidem poetam
tam egregium preconem Achilli legitur inuidisse. Ab hac igitur tam
generosa, tam regia Allexandri mente cum perspexissem pulcherrimam
indolem tuam non abhorrere,. .' For the most part the variants are
unimportant3 but it may be noted that in ll. 9, 17, 51, 56 (opibus) the ms.
agrees with β. 111 1. 64 the reading Stelkommz illustrates the character
of the copying and revision of the MS.

P. 261, Ep. 113 introd. Sixtin took his degree at Siena on 27·8 July 1510.
The University Register (11, f. 158: now in the Archbishop’s Archives at
Siena) describes him as ‘rector seu archipresbiter in ecclesia Hac-
combcfi, in Anglia ³.

P. 275, Ep. 119. 20. The ‘viculus’ in which Erasmus spent the night- of
1 Feb. may probably be identified with St. Just—en-chaussee‚ a small
town on the main road to Paris, 31 mS. from Amiens and 9 from
Clermont. With his indifference to accuracy in trivia] details he might
easily have remembered its name as St. Julien.

P. 299, Ep. 129 introd. An incident of Erasmus' life at Orleans is narrated
in his Apologia acl blasphemias Stum’cae, 13 June 1522 (LB. ix. 372 E):
‘Olim quum agerem Aurelii, audiebam famulam culinariam rixantem
cum matrefamilias. Tandem famula prouocata sic Gallice respondit
dominae nescio quid obiicienti: “Tu mentiris, salua tua pace ''.' But
possibly after the lapse of 25 years he was recalling the episode of
Ep. 55 in the wrong setting.

Pp. 305, 364, Ep. 131 introd. In the Bodleian (90. c. 56) is a revised edition
of Aug. Vincent’s Vergil, s.a., 12⁰, at the end of which is printed a
letter from him to Nic. Bensrott from Paris, 19 March—probably 1501,
when Bensrott was his pupil (cf. Epp. 136, 156).

P. 356, Ep. 152 introd. Peter Gilles’ ΤΙινεηοιῑὶα 011 the death of Maximilian,
Antwerp‚ M. Hillen‚ 1519, is dedicated to Tutor, ‘praeceptori vnice
obseruando ’, and speaks of Tutor's veneration for the dead Emperor.

P. 385, Ep. 174 introd. A Greek ms. of the ‘New Testament, except Revelation
(Evang. 90, Act. 47, P. 14”’, copied by Faber of Deventer, is now in the
Library of the Remonstrant Church at Amsterdam: see Jortin ii. 712
and C. R. Gregory N. T. Proleyomena, 1894, p. 487. Faber's original was
a MS. written by Theodore of Hagios Petros in 1293; and he used also
mss. lent to him by Wessel (cf. Epp. 504. 2, 515. 3-5), and by the Warden
of the Recollets at Zirickzee.

P. 398, Ep. 180 inti-od. A reminiscence of a visit to Antwerp c. 1502—4 is
given in Erasmus’ Responsio adu. sebriffl'tsmtis libellum, March 1529 (LB.
