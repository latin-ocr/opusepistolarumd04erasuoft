64 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1519

1012. To JOHN FEvas.

Epistolae ad diuersos p. 505. Louvain.
HN: Lond. xiii. 3: LB. 269. 9 September <1519 5³).

[The year-date added in H has no value. In 1517 Erasmus was at Antwerp on
this date, and had not recently been to Bruges. Either 1519 or 1520 is possible ;
for in each year he visited Bruges during the summer (Epp. 1013. 2311, 1129.
111). But 1519, when at this date his visit was quite recent, is perhaps the more
probable : see also 1. 7n.

John Fevinus († 27 Nov. 1555) of Furnes was Dean of the Baclielors of Law
at Louvain (Val. Andreas, p. 210). On 15 June 1510 he was appointed canon
at St. Donatian’s, Bruges (J. Gailliard, Inscr. fune'r. de Ια mandre, 1861, i. 135);
where he was an intimate friend of the Dean, Marcus Laurinus (1. 10), and also
of Cranevelt (Ep. 1145). Vives in 1522 praises him as a young man of great
promise (note on Aug. Ciu. Dei, xix. 213 p. 660). He performed the marriage
ceremony, 26 May 1524, for Vives; who presented him with two books now in
the Royal Library at Madrid (A. Bonilla‚ Vives. pp. 757-8). In March <1530 5»
he wrote to Erasmus announcing· that he had been made master of the Cathedral
school at Bruges (EE2. 71, 159). His relations with Erasmus were always cordial.
Above ninety of his letters written to Cranevelt exist in 1115.. and are being
edited by Prof. H. de Vocht of Louvain. One is printed in Geldenhauer’s
Collectanea, ed. J. Prinsen, 1901, pp. 73—4. Adr. Bai-land‘s Inst. artis oratoriae was
dedicated to Fevinus with a preface from Louvain, 13 Feb. 1535 3 but 110 copy of
the first edition is known (Bibl. Belyz'ccc).]
