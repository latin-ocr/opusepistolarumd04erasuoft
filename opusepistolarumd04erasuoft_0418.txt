370 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1520

55 Faxit, obsecro, Deus Op. Max. vt semen vestrum, quod Domino
auxiliante in terram bonam cadit, indies multiplicetur et fructum
afferat quem debet. Vos modo, vti cepistis, pergite, quodque factu
optimum censetis scribite, inuulgate‚ spargite ac inuicem succurrite,
vt conculcatum suffocatumque Christi semen vobis auctoribus succre-

60 seat. quue cum hactenus dilegenter fecistis, tum in posterum ne
cessetis, rogo. Neque enim incassum laborabitis, qui primum
laudem inter homines immortalem promereamini, mox dignam
vestro conatu mercedem accipiatis. Superest vt te rogem vt hoc
meum ad te scribendi propositum boni consulas optimamque in

65 partem interpreteris, neque alia mente isthec a me fieri nisi vt ipse
te magistro ac duce que rectissima sunt sentiam, deinde eadem aliis
quoad possum ante oculos proponam.

Si quid ad ista rescribere voles—rogo autem rescribas—, litteras
tuas Augustam ad Fucaros mittere poteris; nam inde Viennam atque

50 illinc ad me facile perferentur. Orationi me tue interim committo,
optime ac religiosissime Pater. Vale. Ex arce Znoyma.

Artlebus de Bozkowicz et Tschernaho, dominus in Vran, suppremus
capitaneus marchionatus Morauien., sua manu propria.

[When the Emperor left Louvain on 8 Oct. on his ,way to Aachen (p. 353),
Erasmus was not free to accompany him ; being detained by business (Ep. 1152.
1-3). 011 18 Oct. he was still at Louvain (Ep. 1153), though the coronation was
drawing near 3 and he seems to have been there even a day or two later (p. 383).
As Councillor he presumably attended the coronation, at Aachen on 23 Oct.;
though BRE. 181, 8 Nov. 1520, perhaps implies that he was then at. Cologne.
In a letter of 1524 (Ep. 1512; cf. Ep. 1164. 40) Erasmus states that he spent
three weeks at Cologne : on which calculation he must have left shortly
after the Emperor, who set out up the Rhine towards Worms 011 16 Nov. On
his return journey to Louvain Erasmus passed through Aachen and stayed
with his friend Leonard P1·iccard(Ep. 972) ; whom he left 011 a Sunday, probably
18 Nov. (cf. Ep. 1169. 12).

On 5 Nov. he had an interview at Oologne with Duke Frederic of Saxony, at
which he discussed Luther, criticizing especially the ‘immodica maledicentia'
of his w1·itings; see Sponqia, LB. x. 1659 AB = HE. 333, §§ 259,60‚ and cf. Resp.
acl A. Pium, LB. ix. 1117 F. This interview is mentioned by Spalatinus, who was
present, in his Annales, first printed by J. B. Mmmkenius, Script. rer. German„ ii,
1728, 604 : ‘ Die v Nouembr. t Princeps noster, audita re diuina domi, admisit in
colloquium Erasmum Roterodamum, phoenicem illum omnibus seculis admira—
bilem. Deinde adhibuit prandio Fr. Siccingerum et Philippum Dalburgium’.
Spalatinus also composed a more detailed narrative, in his History of the Re-
furmafion, written in German, which is in ms. at Gotha, and has never been
printed in full3 see Seckendorf, De Lutlceranismo‚ 1692, i. 125,6, §81, where it is
translated into Latin, with a wrong mouth-date. From this it appears that after
the interview Spalatinus walked back with Erasmus to the house of Count
Hermann of Neuenahr ; and that there Erasmus sat down and wrote out a series
of 22 Axiomatapro causa Martini Lutlzeri, which 110 handed to Spalatinus, asking to
have them given back to 111111, for sear they should reach Aleander. In spite of this
