318 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1520

populus Christianus seruiet istorum libidini quibus neque frons est

ne ue mens.
{b hospite tuo non minus claro quam humano libens accipio salu-

tem, non vt summus Pontifex, quemadmodum tu ludis, sed vt
infortunatus homuncio, verum qui prodesse Christianis studiis velit
magis quam possit. Nesenus taedio stolidissimarum tragoediarum,
quas hic quidam agunt sine fine, ad vos se recepit. Dor-pius optimis
studiis semet oblectat. Idem nos agimus, quod quidem licet. Bene

vale, doctissime Buschi.

[An original letter in the Burscher collection belonging to the Leipzig Uni-
versity Library: written by a secretary (αῖ), but with the heading, part of the
subscription, and one insertion by Erasmus (αἳ). The verso is blank and the
address-sheet missing. In the Town Library at Zurich (MS. F. 52. 122‚3) are
copies of this and Ep. 1278, made by Seb. Ramspek (fl. 1665-76). Variants show
that they were derived from the Leipzig originals, and not from the printed texts.

The person addressed, and therewith the year-date of this letter, are shown
by an enti-y in the Erfurt matriculation register against the name of the Rector
from May to Oct. 1520, Louis Platz: of whom, after opening with ll. 6-9 of
this letter, the writer proceeds to say, ‘ delectus est in Erfurdiensis Academie
presidem et inclyte familie litterarie moderatorem, prius id ipsum factis strenue
et pro virili moliens quam ad debita sue functionis regimina a magno Erasmo
Roterodamo, in epistola quapiam inter laboriosas sui muneris curas ad illum
scripta, adhortaretur, atque propensissimam animi sui voluntatem erga nobilis-
sime huius vrbis scholas publicas in eadem epistola attestaretur ⁷.

Louis Platz († 1547) of Melsungen‚ 10 ms. s. of Cassel, matriculated at Erfurt
in 1497-8‚ and was M.A. there in 1504. Subsequently he was licentiate in theology.
rector, and member of the Great College ; and in 1530 and 1533 he was Dean of
the Philosophical Faculty. He held the living of Walschleben, near Erfurt ; but
c. 1 Feb. 1536, being ‘pene septuagenarius ', he married (cf. EHE. p. 142). With
Eobanus (Ep. 874), who dedicated to him an Easter hymn in 1515, he was on
terms of intimate friendship 3 of which there are indications in EHE. pp. 231,
155, 230, 185, 175. See C. Krause's Eobanus, 1879.

For Erasmus' ties with many other mem bers of Erfurt University during these
years, before their adhesion to Luther, see Epp. 870-63 and, for a volume of
verses recently printed there in his defence, Ep. 998. 6612. An extract from its
preface, 1 May 1520, expressing unbounded admiration there for Erasmus, is
printed by F. W. Kampschulte, Univ. Ers'urt, 1858, i. 255n.: ‘Cum publicum
totius aetatis dedecus interpreter, esse quibus displiceat Erasmus, esse qui
mordere audeant tot modis pietati iuxta ac optimis studiis vtilem, vt si omnium
qui annos abhinc sexaginta vixerunt labores conferas, aequilibrium non sint

facturi '.]
