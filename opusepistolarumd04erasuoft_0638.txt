[The year-date is sufficiently confirmed by Erasmus' rustication at Anderlecht.

Bernard Bucho (c. 1466—3 Dec. 1528) of Zuichem‚ near Leeuwarden in Fries—
land, was first in the promotion of the Arts Faculty at Louvain, 1487, from the
college du Faucon (Ep. 1217. 121n). He took orders, and after holding Zuichem
and several other village pastorates, succeeded to the great church at 110011-
warden. In 1499 he was appointed by Duke Albert of Saxony, governor of
Friesland (see Ep. 1122. 311), to be a member of the senate of Friesland : being
by that time Licentiate in Law. In 1504 Duke George of Saxony (ef. Ep. 586.
266) appointed him to the executive Council of Friesland, and in 1515 Charles
made him Regent of the province ς 111 which capacity he rendered good service,
by retaining the province in loyalty. He was also sent 011 embassies to France
and England. In reward Charles gave him in 1519 the Deanery of the Hague
and a seat in the Council of Holland; both of which he held until his death.
This is the only letter surviving that passed between him and Erasmus, unless
Ep. 1166 is addressed to him3 but Lond. xx. 80, LB. 1013 indicates warmth of
feeling.

One of Bucho’s nephews was Viglius Zuichem‚ born 19 Oct. 1507 3 who records
in his autobiography continual benefits received from this uncle, who was ‘ like
a father ¹ to him. Bucho sent him to school at Deventer 1519-20, had him and
his brother taught at Leiden with other boys of good family 1520—1 ; and at the
end of 1521 recalled them to the Hague to work with a private tutor, with whom
he sent them to Louvain in Oct. 1522. It is therefore not unlikely that these
may have been the boys about whom Bucho had consulted Erasmus at this'
time: even though in l. 48 they are described as ‘amici tui pueros ’. At his
death he left Viglius a considerable sum of money and a good library.

VZE. 1 and 2, 1525 and 1528, testify Viglius’ gratitude3 which he records also
in editing Theophilus Antecessor’s Iozst. iuris ciuilis, Basle, Froben, March 1534,
and in his own Comment. in Inst. iar. ciuil„ ibid, 1534. The former (f0. α4 v0)
speaks of pati-onage received by Bucho from Maximilian, Margaret of Austria,
and Charles v.
