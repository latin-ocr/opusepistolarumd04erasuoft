330 LETTERS OF ERASMUs [1520

1136. To LEONTIUS.

Epistolae ad diuersos p. 565. Brussels.
HN: Lond. xv. 6 : LB. 560. (c. 29 August ‘?> 1520.

[Erasmus was not often at Brussels. For him to have assigned this letter to
a stay there, when he was adding the dates for H in 1529, perhaps indicates,
therefore, that his memory on such points was clearer than usual here. A visit
to Brussels in 1520, after Charles' return from Spain in June, is mentioned in
Ep. 1198; cf. 1, p. 33. 4, for his meeting with the brothers Lasky there about
this time. Very likely he went thither in the train of Charles3 who, after
spending 23—4 Aug. at Louvain, moved to Brussels on 25 Aug. till 17 Sept.
<Gachard ii. 28). He was certainly there about the end os August 3 for Diirer,
who was at Brussels from 26 Aug. to 3 Sept„ wrote in his Tayebuch (ed. F. Leit-
schuh, 1884, p. 59. 27-8)‚ ‘ Ich hab den Erasmum Roterodam noch einmahl (cf.
p. 324) conterfet'. So this letter may be conjecturally placed at that date. Diirer's
drawing of him, which was made in preparation fora painting (cf. Lond. xxx.
29, LE. 631 of 19 July 1523), was bequeathed to the Louvre by the late
M. Bonnat. It is reproduced licre with the permission of the French Govern-
ment. For a large reproduction of it see the publications of the Diirer Society,
vi (1903), no. 12; also C. Ephrussi, Albert Diu-er et ses (lessius, 1882, p. 277. In
1882 the drawing was in the possession of M. Jean Gigoux.

Of Leontius I can discover nothing; but he appears to have been a school-
master. Among the learned men of Lower Germany enumerated in Golden-
hauer's De Batauorum insula, 1520 (p. 69, ed. P. Scriverius, 1611), 15 a Nicolaus
Leontius Leidensis‚ grammaticus, of whom little seems to be known: cf.
A. Buchellius, Dim-ium, ed. Brom and van Langeraad, 1907, p. 86, where he
is described as Rhetor. It is possible that he is the person addresscd here]

ERASMVS LEON'HO SVO S. D.

Rom consulam audaciam tuam qui ignotus ad ignotum scripseris,
si tu vicissim boni consulueris quod occupatissimus tam parce
respondeam vt prope nihil respondeam. Quod* Musarum cultor es,
magnopere laud03 quod assidue depugnas cum amusis, non probo.
Negligendi sunt qui vinci non possunt: et ita sunt haec studia
commendanda, ne tamen odiose damnentur quibus alii magis
capiuntur. Certe non expedit irritare crabrones, Caeterum quae
nos scripsimus, non in 1100 scripsimus vt inuehantur templis, sed vt
domi legantur. Atque isto tuo studio immodico nihil aliud mihi
quam inuidiam paris. Ego nihil honoris istiusmodi promereor ;
alioqui ne promeritis quidem aperiuntur templa, nisi a rogo, vt aiunt.
Ac mea quidem sententia plus efficies si quod operae sumis in rixando
cum aduersariis, fortasse deploratis, id insumas erudiendae pubi
aut iuuenibus spei melioris, Felicius irrepent bonae literae quam

5i1-rumpent3 ac facilius coalescent, si ciuiliter semet insinuent vt

hospites quam si irruant vt hostes. Nos quod possumus, gratis ac
libenter impartimus3 si quis adferet meliora, non grauate cedimus.
Porro cum clamosis rabulis certamen non nisi coacti suscipimus,
imo ne coacti quidem. Porro vita nostra nihil habet memorabile,

20 nisi quod opinor fortunam nulli constantius infensam fuisse. Proinde

tu, si me audies, aliud argumentum tibi quaeres3 imo quoduis aliud
citius tibi sumes quam hoc. Bene vale. Bruxellae, M.D.xx.
