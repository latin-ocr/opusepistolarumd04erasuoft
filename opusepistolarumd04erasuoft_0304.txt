Epistolae ad diuersos p. 492. Louvain.

HN: Lond. xii. 20: LB. 506. 3 May 1520.

ERASMVS ROTERODAMVS R. P. RICARDO, EPISCOPO
VVINTONIENSI, S. D.

REvERENnE Praesul. Quod Eduardus Leus tam manifestis con·
uiciis debacchatus sit in famam meam, dici non potest quam dis-
pliceat probis omnibus. Nec enim tam mihi nocuit quam omnibus
bonarum studiosis literarum, quorum vtilitati desudat hactenus
nostrum ingenium. Tot amicorum literis tot monitis meis non
potuit deterreri quo minus suae non minus quam meae famae
maculam inureret. Exiit liber malis auibus ; nonnullo detrimento
nominis mei, sed multo maiore ipsius. Ad conuicia respondimus
moderatius quam vellent quidam. Ad argumenta sie respondimus
vt ille nunquam sit responsurus, sat scio, et tamen vbique tempero
a conuiciis.

Nec his contentus Leus adornauit, vt aiunt, alterum libellum
multo etiam virulentiorem, quem misit Lutetiam excudendum.
Non audit amicorum sana consilia, nec vnquam finem facturus est
nisi tua autoritate coherceatur. Atque vtinam id esset factum ante-
quam hoc incendium erupisset! Subornauit Londini Cartusiensem
quendam, opinor nomine Ioannem Batmanson, iuuenem, vt e scriptis

8. Ad conuicia] With the Apologia
qua respondet.

9. Ad argumenta] With the first
Responsio.

12. alterum libellum] If this rumour
had any foundation, it may be conjec-
tured that Lee suppressed his second
hook as a condition of the agreement
indicated by Froben's joint volume (see
p. 110).

17. Batmanson] In 1491-2 John Bat-
manson, M.A.‚ was incorporated at
Cambridge on his Oxford degree, and
in March 149} was admitted to incept
in civil Law. On 15 March 1493, being
then LL.D., he was an arbitrator in a
case between King's College and Trinity
Han: and in the same year he con-
tracted a debt of 208. ‘ pro scholis iuris
ciuilis ' which the University had not
yet recovered in 1523-4. In 1511—12
he was sent to London on University
business (Cambridge Gracc-Book B, ed.
Μ. Bateson, 1903-5, pt. 1, pp. 36, 58, 72 :
pt. 2, pp. 2, 120).

On 16 March 150} John Batemanson,
LL.D., an advocate in the Gourt of
Canterbury, was present as a formal
witness at the election of Wm. Salyng
(Ep. 624. 6n), Prior of Merton ; see
A. Heales, Records ⁰s Merton Ρνίοτῃ, 1898,
p. 312. In Sept. 1509 he was sent as
acommissioner to Scotland to attest
the oath of J ames lv, and was employed
later on the Scottish marches (ef. Bod-
leian MS„ Engl. misc. c. 33, no. 3) and
in the suppression of piracy. He also
gave assistance with the Lady Mar-
garet's will. See Brewer i and ii. On
20 June 1517 he was present at St.
Cross, by winchester, when Foxe gave
his statutes for Corpus Christi College,
