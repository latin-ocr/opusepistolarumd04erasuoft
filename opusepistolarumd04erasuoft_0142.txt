98 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1519

the Bishop of Basle kssf· Ep. 598 introd.), 1 Sept. 1520, wishing that all the
bishops and nobles of Germany would unite to secure from the Pope favourable
treatment sor Luther. This edition was very likely produced from a copy, ms.
or printed, left behind at Schlettstadt by Egranus (Ep. 872. 12n) in the summer
of 1520, at Beatus’ request (BRE. 176).

οι1 and α2 (designated together as α) are clearly connected. In a large number
of readings they agree together against all the other sources, and differences
between them are few. The contents of the pages exactly correspond, though
the arrangement of the lines is not identica13 a condition which is frequently
found when a book is reprinted after a short interval of time, e.g. with N ¹, N2,
N3. Some of the obvious misprints of ‹21 are corrected in α’ ; and are not shown
in the critical notes here. But α2 1133 3 few errors of its own, which have crept
into the text through aber-ration, in spite of the ‘ castigation ’ 31111011ηοοᾶ 111 1110
colophon. This pair agree, too, in printing Ep. 980 after tbis letter: according
to the text of the Farrago (E), and therefore not before Nov. 1519 (Ep. 1040
introd.). A possible indication of date may be found in another point. The
colophon 111 both cases follows on to Ep. 980 at once, in the same line 3 and in α2
the year-date of Ep. 980 has been altered from mamm 1ο unxx. This suggests that
the printers of ass—seemingly different from those of αἱ, 33 the type is not the same
—took the date as applying to the book, not the letter. They probably knew when
(1ι appeared ; and, making this misconception, thought it suitable in reissuing the
pamphlet to change the date into accord with the actual year of reissue. Thus ιι1
and 112 may be dated conjecturally in the end of 1519 and the beginning of 1520.

In J an. 1520 a copy of the letter, apparently in ms„ reached Wittenberg (LE.²
264), and Luther expected that it would soon be printed. But, as in April
Melanchthon sent to John Hess, canon of Breslau (cf. Ep. 1113 introd.) a ms.
copy of it, corrected by himself (ME. 69), we may perhaps infer that he had not
yet seen it in print. Hutten, in passing through Bamberg about the end of
April, showed the letter, perhaps in α1 01 (2², to Crotus Rubianus‚ who, being
greatly pleascd with it, at 01100 prepared to send a copy to Luther (HE. 160 =
LE.2 300. 228-31). Ι11 view of the priority of these indications in time, the
Wittenberg issue (131) may have precedence of the others here. In June 1520
Pirckheimer from Nurembcrg sent ² Epistolam Erasmi emendatam ’ to Bernard
Adelmann, who at 01100 had it printed at Augsburg (Heumann, p. 199). These
two editions—if the former was printed, not ms. (l. 45 shows a connexion between
7¹ and αἳ, 1110 ⁴ emended’ a¹)—rnay quite well be -γι and 212, which agree closely
together. They agree also with 7³, and, according to the date, either of them
might have been the original used by Petri, for in his book the letter is on the
first sheet, which was probably one of the last set up. To δ 3 date can be
assigned with very little doubt from Wimpfeling's letter. Except for a few
insignificant variations it follows γ, and may therefore be presumed to have been
printed from one of those originals. BEr1 mentions editions at Louvain and
Erfurt, which I have not seen; the latter no doubt owed its origin to one of
Erasmus' admirers there. In the Gotha MS. Chart. Β. 20, ff. 19—24 there is a
contemporary copy (3²) which shows a great deal of degeneration, but on the
whole has distinctive connexion with 13¹. The contents of the ms. suggest that
it was written by or for someone who had an interest in Breslau, perhaps John
Hess, in which case the connexion with βι would be explained. ,

This is perhaps the letter sent by Zwingli to Oswald Myconius from Zurich,
6 J uly 1520, ⁴ Erasmi epistolam preciosissimam ab exemplari descriptam, quod
ipsum improbe descriptum erat’ (Zw. Est 146); though for another possible
identification of that see Ep. 1120. 12n. As late as 3 Aug. 1520 Conrad Grebel
saw this letter in ms. at Zurich (ΥΕ. 207). Of the German version mentioned
by Petri, numerous contemporary editions are known.

If Hutten was responsible for any of the texts enumerated above, it must have
been for a¹ 3 but I cannot find there, nor anywhere else, the one specific change
-the addition of‘ noster ⁹ after Luther's name —which Erasmus in Epp. 1153. 165,

101101· himself. It was a composition of some note. He realized no doubt (cf.
Ep. 1041) the importance of making clear his attitude towards Reuchlin and
Luther, whose nameS, for different reasons, had now become a cause of anxiety
to the orthodox ; and so, while continuing the moderate support already mani-
tested in Epp. 939, 967 (cf. also Ep. 1153. 110-16), he was careful to assert his
