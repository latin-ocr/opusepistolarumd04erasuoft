bitur hic filii familiae adiungendus, agam cum illo, et agam non
minore fide quam si filii mei negocium ageretur: sin minus, scito
Erasmum toto pectore tuum esse. Bene vale.

Louanii post. Cal. Octobr. Anno M.D.X1x.
1019. To MARTIN LYPSIUS.
Brussels MS. 4850-7, f. 149. <Louvain.>

(October 1519 ‘?>

[For the ms. see Ep. 296 inti-od. Lypsius' argument is : ‘ Leus vacillans
mittere velit Annotationes necne, aliquando missurum pollicebatur, subitoque
mutatus 11011 missurum se scribebat, id adferens excusationis quod co-Angli sui
hoc dissuaderent. Tandem ob Nouum Testamentum donatum in quo locos
plurimos correxerat, sciscitatum occultandumne esset ob sui securitatem, certum
reddit (Erasmus) F<ratrem) M<artinum>.’ In this last sentence I have written
sciscitatum for sciscitatus of the MS. ; taking the sense to be that, in pursuance of
the intrigue to obtain a sight of Lee’s notes zos. Ep. 998. 1711), Lypsius had lent
Lee his own copy of the second edition of Erasmus' New Testament [cf. Ep. 955),
and subsequently, in sear lest Lee should notice the numerous corrections made
111 that edition and use them for further attacks on Erasmus, had enquired
whether 116 should endeavour to conceal the fact of the corrections; and that
Erasmus assured him it would not matter.

No precise date is possible 3 butas by 16 Oct. Erasmus was aware of the advice
os Lee’s English friends (Epp. 1026. 11-16, 1029. 10-15), this letter, which deals
with Lee’s announcement on the subject, may be placed conjecturally earlier in
the mouth. For the course of Erasmus’ controversy with Lee see pp. 108—11.]

S.P. Crede mihi, Leus te ridet, et hoc nomine sibi videtur vafer et
catus Nec hoc agit vt premat suas AnnotationeS, vnde sperat
immortalitatem, sed vt instructiores aedat. De libro misso, ex me
nihil erit periculi ; nec video tibi periculum, etiamsi resciscat. Imo
si sciat omnia, mihi nihil sit ex Leo periculi: quanquam‘cum leone
rem habere malim quam cum tali vulpe. Bene vale.

1020. FRoM BoNirACE AMERBACH.

Basle MS. (LXI-2. 73. 186. Basle.
7 October 1519.

[An autograph ; one of Boniface Amerbach's rough-drafts, in the collection of
them at Basle, Mss. C. VIR. 54 and 73. The letters belong mostly to the years
1519-36, and number about 550: including more than ninety to Zasius, about
sixty each to Alciati and Erasmus, and others to well-known humanists‚ Beatus
Rhenanus, Hutten, Glareanus, Dorp, Sadolet‚ Botzheim, besides his brother
Basil and some intimate friends. Seventy-five of them are printed by Th. Burck-
hardt Biedermann in Am. E„ some nearly complete⁷ others in brief extract3
and there is a short description of the collection in the Transactions ofthe Biblio-
yrciplcical Society, xii (1914), pp. 78-80.

The letter actually sent to Erasmus perhaps contained as a postscript (of which
there is no trac-e in this rough-draft) a proposal that Jerome Froben (Ep. 903. 211)
should be put to study law under Zasius at Freiburg, as Bonit'ace had done. See
a note from Zasius to Boniface 9213. p. 483) ι ‘ Quod nuper ad magnum Erasmum
scripsisti in calce literarum super Frobenio, legere male oculatus non potui.
Itaque siquid officii dicto adolescenti per me praestari poterit, declarato, et
paratum ad tua eiusque commoda inuenies ⁹. If this conjecture is correct, it
seems likely that Jcrome carried this letter, together with BRE. 132.

The date of this letter is confirmed by Boniface's projected Journey (l. 54n).]

1018. 17. apiani] Ep. 1192. 8122 shows that Erasmus fulfilled this promise.
