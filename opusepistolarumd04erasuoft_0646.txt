596 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1 52 1

proxime essem Louanii, sic obesulus, rubicundulus et alacer eras, vt
mihi lite non macerari sed saginari videaris. Et habes te dignum
20 aduersarium Ioannem Calabrum medicum, qui te pallore macieque
refert: excepta aetate adeo tui non dissimilis. vt periculum sit ne
cui videaris litigare cum patre. Quanquam vir ille mea sententia
non peccauit malicia sed obsequio. Bene vale. Resci chariss.
Anderlaci. Anno M.D.XX1.

[The manuscript, as Merula had it, was either defective in a few places or
else undecipherable: the gaps are not easy to fill. The year-date is established
by the reference to the Diet of VVorms, and by the movements of Capito.

He had just returned from a visit to Wittenberg, where he spent two days
c. 30 Sept. t ef. ME. 142, 3037 and BRE. 212. The purpose of his going, in which
he was accompanied by Sti-omer (Ep. 578), was to urge the friends of Luther,
and through them Luther himself, to moderation, in the hope that his patron,
the young Archbishop of Mainz, might be induced to countenance Luther‘s
views, if not too uncompromisingly expressed. Albert had indeed recently
shocked Luther by reopening the sale of indulgences at Halle on 15 Sept. (LE. ²
459, 461 and BRE. 212); but Capito hoped that with care he might be peisuaded
to abandon the traffic. To Luthel. however compromis ·e was impossible. On
1 Dec. he wrote to the Archbishop 1101111111ςὶ1ηέ th at induloences should be given
up and that priests who wished to mariy should be freely allowed to do so
(LE. 469). Albert replied in ostensille humility (ΒΕΖ). 475), which aroused
hopes in Luther (JE. 73)· ‚ and Capito did his best to mediate with a long lettel
(LE ². 474), sent-with the Archbishop’s, and having considerable resemblance to
this, which had been written two months earlier. ‘When Luther’s hopes were
disappointed (cf. LE ². 479), Capito fell for a time into disgrace with him ; but
on 12 March 1522 he made his way to VVittenberg and obtained pardon (BRE.

220>.]
