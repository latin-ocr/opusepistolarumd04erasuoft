358 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1520

In the rapid development of the crisis Faber soon found himself driven into
strong disapproval of Luther‚ and was unable to maintain a mediating position.
With the humanists too he ceased to be in sympathy: cf. Hutten's Expostulatio
(HE. 310, ξ 137), and the Sponqia‚ supra. In Augsburg he was again in difficulties,
and in 1525 was ejected from his house: to die in exile and obscurity (ΕΕ. 145).
Erasmus' opinion of him at the end was exceedingly bitter (Lond. xxiv. 15, xxvi.
18; LB. 1072, 1163). See an excellent study by N. Paulus in Deutsclze Domini-
kanerim Kampse yeyen Lutlzer, 1903, pp. 292-313; expanded from an article in
Hist. Jahrbuch, xvii (1896), pp. 39—60: also A. Schulte, Die Fuyyer m Rom, 1904, i.
161—6. ii. 208-9, with extracts from Faber’s Gediichtnz'sbzcclc.

Of Villinger not much is known. He was at school at Schlettstadt under
Grato Hofman (BRE. 1633, to whom he subsequently joined in raising a monu-
ment (ibid. p. 619). By 1501 he had entered Maximilian's treasury, where his
life was to be spent as a trusted and competent official ; and by 1513 he had
risen to be its head. In 1504 he distinguished himself in battle against the
Bohemians, and was knighted: see f. 76 of Spiegel's edition of the Staurostickon
of J. F. Pico, Tubfflgen, Anshelm, July 1512, the commentary of which is dedi-
cated to Villinger. So also are Cuspinianus' Gonyressns . . . Caesaris et trium Requm,
Vienna, (c. 1515>; Gebwiler’s Libertas Germaniae, Strasburg, J. Schott, 15193
and an edition of Prudentius in the name of the Schlettstadt Literary Society,
L. Schurer, 1520 (BRE. 163). Gebwiler extols him also in Pcmeyiris carolina,
Strasburg‚ J. Pruss, Aug. 1521, f. 8. His estates at Schoenenberg have not been
identified 3 but as he was an Alsatian, they were perhaps at Schoenenburg, s. of
Weissenburg. When Erasmus moved to Freiburg in 1529, he lived for some
time in a house which Villinger had built for Maximssian, and afterwards
acquired for himself (Ν. 488-91) ; but by 1531 Villinger was already dead
(Lond. xxx. 20, LB. 12103 Q. 4; ΕΕ. 153 ; EE2. 92). His official correspondence is
preserved in the Archives at Marburg. See G. Knod, J. Spieqess 1884, p. 193
H. Ulmann, Kaiser Maximillam Ι, 1884, 1. pp. 819 seq. ς and ΕΕ.

ERASMVS ROT. CLAfflSS. VIRO D. IACOBO VILLINGERO‚ ROMANI
ET HISPAN. REGIS THESAVRARIO, S. D.

QVOD de nomine duntaxat tibi notus ad te scribo, vir incompara-
bilis, non debes imputare meae impudentiae sed tuae ab omnibus
praedicatae humanitati. Quod si me ab impudentiae crimine non
absoluis, certe leuius damnabis si cogitaris hanc improbitatem ab
humanitate profectam esse. Nam vt sic auderem, extorserunt a me
huius egregii viri D. Ioannis Fabri preces vel merita potius. In quo
cum tot egregias dotes perspexerim, raram morum integritatem,
eruditionem haud quaquam vulgarem, iudicium acre, fidem et
humanitatem incredibilem, existimabam me gratiam etiam initurum
apud tuam celsitudinem, qui t-ibi hominem efficerem notum, aut, si
iam notus est, efficerem notiorem; qui pro tua singulari probitate
proque fide erga Principem soles impense fauere iis quorum virtuti-
bus intelligis ornari simul et fulciri monarchias. Inter hos vel me
autore pones hunc Ioannem Fabrum, si quid omnino iudico, non

5 vulgare decus ordinis sui: qui vel citra nostrum officium se tibi suis

dotibus abunde commendabit, vbi propius hominem inspexeris. De
meipso non video quid possim polliceri, animum certe ac studium
fidemque polliceor, si qua in re voles Erasmi in te obseruautiam
explorare. Bene vale. Louanii v. nonas Octobr. ANNo M.D.xx.
