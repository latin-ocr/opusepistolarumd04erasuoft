greet Charles v 011 his return from
Spain ; and made the acquaintance of
Erasmus then, at Brussels and Cologne

responded with him in 1525-6 (Epp.
1622. 1751).

Hieroslaus continued to play a lead-

of Louis 11 ofHungary at Mohacz, 1526,
secured the succession of J olm Zapolya,
national claimant—king against Ferdi-

obtain Tui-kieh consent. For intrigue
with Ferdinand‚ Zapolya disgraced and
iinprisoned him 31 Aug. 1534; but
next year he was released and coin-
pensated (cf. Lond. xxvii. 24, LB.

Ferdinand, he only made himself dis-

death (1540) he was again sent to
Constantinople in Ferdinand's name,
in connexion with the succession ; but
was iniprieoned there, 1540-1, and
carried back by the Sultan when he
visited Hungary in person. On retir-
ing from Belgrade the Sultan released
him, and he made his way back to
Cracow to die.

a letter from Cracow, 28 June 1537,
printed by T. Wierzbowski, Materyalqy

· Dominus Hieronimus Laski palatinus
hisce proximis diebus quatuor castella

in confinio Poloniae et Hungariae ex-
pugnauit, et in deditionem Regis
Ferdinandi accepit : et tamen nulla 051
