stilum partim oratione, partim epistolis cohibui3 cohibiturus etiam,
quantum erit in me. Sed audio quosdam his atrociora minari: quod
genus si quid accideret (id quod Deus auertat), nec ego possem tuo

„ mederi malo, et, vt est nunc prona hominum suspicio, inuidia facti in

meum quoque caput recideret. Ita ex tuo malo mihi duplex incom-
modum nasceretur, primum ipse dolerem mea causa laesum esse cui
nihil tale velim accidere, deinde non deerunt qui suspicentur me
conniuente factum. Iam, vt spero nihil huiusmodi futurum, ita
contra metuo ne quid accidat. Si nihil est periculi, amice timui ; sin
est, amicius praemonui, quo possis, si videtur, aliquo consilio occur-
rere quod tuae prudentiae videbitur esse commodissimum. Bene vale.

9ffi999. To ULRmH HUTTEN.

Farrago p. 329. Antwerp.
F. p. 432: HN: Lond. x. 30: LB. 447. 23 July 1519.

[This letter, composed at Hutten's request, is the earliest biography of More.
Two years later Erasmus wrote a sketeh of More's family to Budaeus (Ep. 1233) ;
and again in 1533 he wrote to John Faber, bishop of Vienna (Ep. 386), describing
the household as he had heard of it at Chelsea (Lond. xxvii. 8, LB. App. 426).
The greater part of this letter to Hutten (down to l. 297) is printed in J. Fichard's
Virorum illustrium Vitae, Franksort, C. Egenolph', Sept. 1536, ff. 112—16, from the
text of F. Appended to it, with a short connecting passage, is the portion of
LB. App. 378 which deals with More. For all the details of More's life Sir
Sidney Lee's article in DNB is an invalnable source. Ι am indebted for some
notes and suggestions to a reviewer in the Athenaeum, 2 Jan. 1909.

It looks at first sight as though, Epp. 1000 and 1007 notwithstanding, Erasmus
might have been at Antwerp from 23 July to 15 Aug. continuously ε but in fact
his movements at this time were rapid. As he probably met Pace not later than
25 July (Ep. 1001. 53n), it seems likely that he went to Antwerp for the purpose
just at this time, and travelled back with Pace on the way to Mechlin, which
would serve also for his own return to Louvain. The place-date of Ep. 1000 is
confirmed by Ep. 1001. 3. within a few days he was in Antwerp again, having
visited Mechlin on his way (Ep. 1001. 7) 3 and he was still there on 15 Aug. (Ep.
1009). The place-dates of Epp. 1007,ss conflict3 cf. the introductions to Epp.
962, 965. If Louvain is not a mere evei-Sight in Ep. 1007, it may be conjectured

that in writing on important matters to the Pope, Erasmus preferred to give his 1

permanent address.

A letter of this character clearly was not composed durIng a hurried excursion
to Antwerp. The biographical part had no doubt been thought out at leisure in

Louvain ; and was then taken to Antwerp on the chance of finding a messenger ¹

returning to Germany, possibly someone in Pace’s escort, through whom, when

thrown into epistolary form, it might be delivered to Hutten. Mr. Nichols ι

proposes (iii. 386—7, 401-2) to date this letter in 1517, arguing solely from a
calculation made from the figures of More's age (ll. 56-8)—a class of statements
in which Erasmus' memory is netto be trusted (cf. 1, p. 2. 26n). In face of the
