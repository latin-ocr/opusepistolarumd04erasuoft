210 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1520

1083. FROM WOLFGANG FABRICIUS CAPITO.

Epistolae aliquot eruditorum, f0. F⁴ (a). Basle.
Epistolae eruditorum virorum, p. 141 (β). 17 March 1520.

[While Erasmus was completing his reply to Lee, with his Apologia and two
Responsiones (pp. 109, 110), Η111011, who had printed these at Antwerp, published
also a pamphlet expressing the vie ws of some of Erasmus' friends ε Epistolae aliquot
eruditorum, ‘nunquam antehac excusae, ‘multis nominibus dionae quae leqantur a bonis
omnibus, quo magis liqueat quanta sit insignis· cuiusdam sycophantae virulentia, s. a. (ΕΑΒ).
This consists of eight letters referring to the controversy: two (this and Ep.
1084) which had recently been received by ’Erasmus ; three addressed by Lupset
(cf. Ep. 1053) from Corpus Christi College‚ exford, 30 March-1 April 1520, to
Lee, Paynen, and Nesen at Louvain, and two letters of More also communicated
by Lupset (ΕΑΒ, 1¹⁰. ΒΞ v⁰3 Env, p. 53); and finally Nesen's reply to Lupset,
20 April (1520), which, as standing second in the book indicates a date of
publication early in May 1520. Epp. 1085, 1088 show clearly that Erasmus was
cognizant of the undertaking, and, if not actually the promoter, gave it full
encouragement, when 01100 110 had consented to it ; and even without such direct
evidence, his complicity might have been inferred from the insertion in each
portion of EAE of letters addressed to him. From the facts of composition Steitz
is clearly right (Arclz. f. F1·anlcsz.crts Gesch.‚ NF. vi, 1877, pp. 102-3) 111 supposing that
Nesen edited the pamphlet (ef. Ep. 1088. 10). There are two copies of it in the
British Museum (1009. c. 32 and G. 1568).

Later in the year Hilleu brought out another issue with an Appendix Epistozarum
quibus eruditi viri detestari-tur Edouardi Lei virulentiam, on new signatures, a and b.
This contains four new letters, one from Listrius to Beatus Rhenanus (BRE. 193),
one from Hutten to Lee (HE. 166), and two more addressed to Erasmus (Epp.
1095, 1109) ; the latest being dated 5 June. For this again Nesen was no doubt
responsible. His own copy of it is in the Town Library at Frankfort on the
Main (Steitz, op. cit, p. 103). q

Finally in August 1520 an enlarged edition of the collection was printed by
Froben with the title, Epistolae aliquot eruditorum virorum,-ex quibus perspicuum quanta
sit Eduardi Lei virulentia (ERV). It contains fourteen new letters : two (Epp. 1078,
1053) prefixed3 four inserted in the body of the work—three from More and
Pace to Lee, dated in Feb. and March, and one of Marquard of Hattstein (Ep.
1109. 2911) 10 Celet, from Mainz, 26 April 1520; and at the end eight—two
written to Erasmus (Epp. 1089, 1105) and six which evidently were contributed
from Schlettstadt and Basle, including BRE. 168, 170—thc latest letter being
dated in the last days of August. It is noticeable that in this edition the dates
of three of the letters in EAE, and of one in the Appendice, have suffered change;
probably through mere degeneration. A letter which might have been included,
is one from Mutianus Rufus to John Lang of Erfurt 3 written in scathing con-
demnation of Lee’s book, which he had just seen, 24 May 1520 (MRE. 634 =
ΜΒΕ.2 590).

Τ1118 final volume clearly was concocted by Erasmus’ friends in England and
at Basle, and possibly without his knowledge. For after the attempted recon-
ciliation in the summer of 1520 (Ep. 1037 introd.) he may well have wished the
controversy at an end and have done what 110 could to cheek it (cf. Ep. 1139. 99—
102). Only three letters (Epp. 1078, 1089, 1105) of those added in ERV came from
his unprinted correspondence3 and these were quite likely contributed by the
writers (cf. Ep. 1089 introd.) In November he endeavoured to withdraw the
publication altogether (Ep. 1157).

Copies of EAE were sold by John Dorne in Oxford on 25 and 30 Aug. 1520, and
of the Appendioe on 31 Aug. and 9 Sept. : see 1108. 1133. 1179, 1180, 1183, 1244 in
his Dens-book, ed. F. Madau, OHS. v, 1885, pp. 117,18.

This lcttcr, which perhaps answers Ep. 1074, appears in EAE: its year-date
nceds no confirmation. For Capito's opinion of Lcc 800 also Zw. Ε.2 132]
