438 LETTERS OF ERASMUS [1521
mea responsio copiosa iam pridem excusa sit Basileae. Demiror te
citatum esse Romam, cum sciam Pontificem hoc in primis dedisse in

5 mandatis, ne quem innoxium laederent, imo conscios etiam ac
fautores, vt ipsi vocant, haereseos modis omnibus allectarent. Sed
aliter visum est furiosis theologis aliquot. Cupio te quam optime
valere, ac fugere postea faeliciter.

Ego hic in quotidianis concionibus lapidor a Praedicatoribus, et

10 Luthero copulor, quicum mihi nihi] est negocii; sed ita stolide rem
gerunt vt populus etiam crassissimus intelligat. Non poterunt magis
officere Romano Pontifici, neque magis Lutherum commendare
affectibus hominum. Nunc demum incipiunt illi fauere. Vtinam
Leo sciret quibus modis hic res agatur! In illos primum esset leo.

[1521 is the only year possible between the issue of Exsurge, Domine xl· 115) and
the publication of F. As this letter clearly answers Ep. 1154, Ι have assigned
to it an address (11. 144—5> written by Erasmus himself, at the foot of the
ms. of Ep. 1154, immediately below Artlebus' signatum. It is noticeable that
before deciding 011 Boscowici (l. 144 ³ as the form of this doubtless strange name,
Erasmus· began Bos, but then scratched it through. The anonymous heading
(cf. Ep. 1127 tit. n) given in F probably arose from Erasmus' omission to prefix
Artlebus’ correct name and titles to the rough drast, frOm which, of course, this
letter was printed; and for the subsequent editions he was no doubt unable to
recall them, at any rate with sufficient accuracy.]

plaint which under the circumstances
Erasmus might easily have confused

a citizen of Nuremberg. Great in-
fluence was brought to bear upon Eck

with the previous failure of Ep. 856 to
reach its destination. Or perhaps
Pirckheimer. finding no mention of
Ep. 856 in Ep. 1139, had raised the
subject again in a recent letter.

1182. 3. responsio] Erasmus clearly

Ξ. citatum] Eck in publishing the
Buufflp. 1141.20n)‚which commanded
Luther to recant (cf. Ep. 1153. 3511),
had received the power to put into it
other persons as well; and had pro-
cceded to insert the names of Huttcn,
Pii-ckheimer‚ and Laz. Spengler, also

to induce him to cancel these names 3
but he was obdurate, and in time the
recantation was enforced. Meanwhile
a fresh mandate, dated 3 Jan. 1521, was
forwarded to the nuncios (see P. Bal-an,
Mon. Reform. Lutheranae, 1884, pp. 17-21,
274-5)‚ informing them that absolution
10 the offenders would only be granted
at Rome. See also Ep. [244. 4n.
